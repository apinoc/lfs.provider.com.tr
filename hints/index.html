     <h1>What are LFS Hints?</h1>
     <p>The LFS Hints are small documents that explain how to do things
        that are not covered in the LFS or BLFS books. They provide a variety
        of information such as alternative ways of building and configuring
        packages, information on new/unstable packages that haven't yet made
        it into the books, specialized techniques for specific hardware, and
        other areas that are of interest to LFS users.
     </p>
     <p>If you have a specific problem which is not answered by LFS, BLFS,
        the FAQ or the project documentation, chances are there is a hint
        written about it, detailing everything you need to know. And if there
        isn't, you can <a href="howtowrite.html">write one yourself</a>!
     </p>
     <p>Have fun reading or writing!
     </p>

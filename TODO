- Create cronjob to check for broken links and HTML/CSS validity errors
  (post-commit is not an option here, because these tasks take too much time to
  finish). Maybe create a "quick-check" rule (using xmllint) to be run on
  post-commit, that checks for trivial validation errors.

- Sort out how to make best use of mirrors. RR-DNS would be the best solution,
  but requires more work/research. Another option is to display the mirrors'
  list when the user visits http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/, but the "normal"
  content when accessing http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/index.html explicitly.
  For now, a link to the mirror page was placed on each submenu until we figure
  out which way to go.

      <h1>BLFS 6.2.0 Release Notes</h1>
         <p>Version 6.2.0 of BLFS has been released. Version 6.2.0 is the
         complement to the LFS 6.2 book. More time has elapsed between the
         release of the previous version (6.1) and this one than in any other
         release cycle. Much of this is due to the fact that LFS 6.2 took much
         longer to be released than was originally anticipated. Many new
         packages have been introduced in the 6.2.0 version, as well as many
         updates, refinements and additions to the existing packages.</p>

         <p>The BLFS book now provides build and configuration instructions for
         almost 400 packages (600 if you count every individual package in the
         new Xorg instructions). Some of the new packages introduced in this
         version are: autotooled XOrg, HAL, D-BUS, GStreamer (now broken out
         into separate plugin packages), usbutils, libquicktime, GraphViz, K3b,
         dvd+rw-tools, NSS, Libidn, GAIM, Poppler, SeaMonkey, XChat, Audacious,
         cairo and unixODBC. Major updates include GNOME-2.14.3 (with several
         new GNOME packages such as Totem, gnome-mount and
         gnome-volume-manager), KDE-3.5.6, Firefox-1.5.x, Thunderbird-1.5.x,
         and most of the mainline server packages. As always, the list of
         packages that have been upgraded or added as well as configuration and
         build command changes are annotated in the Change Log.</p>

         <p>Unfortunately, BLFS activity was semi-stagnant for several months
         after (and shortly before) the LFS 6.2 release. Therefore, many of the
         packages are somewhat dated (compared to previous BLFS versions). This
         brings us to why the versioning scheme has changed. This release is
         6.2.0 as we fully anticipate releasing another version (6.2.1) just as
         soon as possible. The 6.2.1 release will also be based on the LFS-6.2
         book, but will include updated packages, and fixes for any errors
         which may be discovered in 6.2.0.</p>

         <p>As always, the main thrust of BLFS development will be to support
         the changes in the current LFS development book, but any changes or
         updates to the BLFS development book (that are compatible with LFS
         6.2) will also be merged into the BLFS 6.2 branch. This way, a 6.2.1
         version of BLFS should be released fairly soon, and should provide a
         very current and stable Linux platform.</p>

         <p>Enjoy!</p>

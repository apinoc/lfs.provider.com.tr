    <p style="font-style: italic;">This page is in alphabetical order of packages,
    and if a package has multiple advisories the newer come first.</p>

    <p> The links at the end of each item point to fuller details which have

    books.</p>

    <p>In general, the severity is taken from upstream, if supplied, or from
    NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/) if an analysis is available there,
    but individual severity ratings at NVD can change over time. If no other
    information is available, 'High' will normally be assumed.</p>

    <!-- After a release, copy for next book version, leave just template stuff
     and initially say "There are no known vulnerabilities." -->

<!-- start of list: Order is Alphabetic by package name (create multiple entries
     if more than one package is involved, e.g. for those firefox updates which

    <h3>XDG-Utils</h3>

    <h4>10.1 024 XDG-Utils Date: 2021-04-02 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In the xdg-email component of xdg-utils 1.1.0rc1 and newer, an attacker
    could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a sensitive
    file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment was
    added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information
    disclosure. Until this is fixed upstream, either do not use mailto links, or
    always double-check there are no unwanted attachments before sending emails.

     <h1>BLFS Security Advisories</h1>

     <p>BLFS used to keep details of Security Vulnerabilities in the Errata,
     mostly updating them to point to the latest version in the development book
     and updating the brief text if a subsequent vulnerability was reported.</p>

     <p>Now they are being shown individually with more details. Please note
     that vulnerabilities to package versions before those in our release
     are not noted, so if you are running a version of BLFS before 10.0 you
     should check the Errata for past releases as well as monitoring the items
     here, and similarly if you are not on the current release you should check
     the advisories for the previous release(s).</p>

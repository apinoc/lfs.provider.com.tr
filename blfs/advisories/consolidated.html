    <h1>LFS and BLFS Security Advisories from September 2020 onwards</h1>

    <p>LFS has not reported Security Vulnerabilities in the Errata, at least
    recently, but tickets for some new versions have had details.</p>

    <p>BLFS used to keep details of Security Vulnerabilities in the Errata,
    mostly updating them to point to the latest version in the development book
    and updating the brief text if a subsequent vulnerability was reported.</p>

    <p><em>This page is a consolidated list for both LFS and BLFS.</em></p>

    <p>This list contains summary details and links to upstreams or CVEs where
    available. Please note that vulnerabilities to package versions before those
    in our 10.0 releases are not noted, so if you are running a version of BLFS
    before 10.0 you should check the Errata for past releases as well as
    monitoring the items here.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">This page is ordered like the Changelog of the
    books, with newest items first.</p>

    <p>The severity ratings are best estimates unless either upstream
    or NVD has assigned a rating. If no other analysis is available,
    High will usually be assumed and similarly if a crash can be triggered
    LFS and BLFS will normally rate that as High. If in doubt, read the links.</p>

    <!-- Editors: Commented entry to copy, and reminder about patches

    If there is a CVE, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-YYYY-NNNN
    shows severities.  If not, cve.mitre.org may show some details.
    However, for fresh releases the number will probably be marked as
    'Reserved'. If upstream assigns a severity (often higher than nvd)
    go with that. If in doubt, usually default to High.

    Start the id with the latest book version, then next number - reset number
    to 1 after we release.

    <!-- Editors: This batch of advisories for the 10.1 books point to the
    development books until we make a release. After a release, new advisories
    for 10.2 need to point to the development books, but the existing 10.1
    advisories need to be changed to point to 10.2 (sic), not 'stable' which
    is a symlink and can change over time. That might sound odd, but the 10.1
    advisories were developed during the build up to 10.2, so in normal
    circumstances the 'or later' will be valid for the 10.2 release, but over
    the longer term who knows what will happen to packages (e.g. getting

    <h4>10.1 062 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-06-16  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux 5.12.10 and earlier, several security vulnerabilities existed
    in the Bluetooth, Xen (virtualization), and wireless networking stacks.
    The Bluetooth vulnerability can allow for denial of service by allowing
    a local user to cause a kernel panic by attaching a malicious HCI TTY
    Bluetooth device. The Xen vulnerability can allow for the network adapter
    on the host system to fail due to a driver crash in the kernel. This
    vulnerability can be exploited through a virtual machine running on
    the system. The wireless stack vulnerabilities impact all cards and
    could allow for decryption of encrypted packets sent over Wi-Fi Protected
    Access (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) packets due to
    a protocol issue that does not require all fragments in a frame to be
    signed by a single key. Another vulnerability in the ath11k wireless driver
    can allow for an attacker to inject and decrypt packets in a connection
    that uses WPA or WPA2 with the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol. Another
    vulnerability in the ath10k driver allows for a remote attacker to
    inject arbitrary packets since the plaintext QoS header in a packet is not
    required to be authenticated under thw WPA, WPA2, WPA3, or WEP standard. 
    Another vulnerability in the wireless stack allows for arbitrary network
    packets to be injected and for the exfiltration of user data regardless of
    whether any encryption is in place, and fragments are not cleared from memory
    after reconnecting to a network.

    <h4>10.1 058 Polkit      Date: 2021-06-06 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Polkit-0.119, a security vulnerability was fixed that can allow
    for unprivileged users to gain root access on the system by calling
    a process that uses "polkit_system_bus_name_creds_sync" too many times,
    and also by not checking for the error value correctly. This vulnerability
    can be used by an unprivileged local attacker to bypass authorization and
    escalate privileges up to the root user. This affects polkit back to 0.113.

    vulnerability that allows for DHCP leases to be improperly deleted,
    or for the DHCP client and server services to be terminated
    improperly. This is due to a buffer overrun, and may be exploited
    remotely to allow for a denial of service (network outage) or
    for improper DHCP leases to be issued. No user interaction is
    required. If you use dhclient or dhcpd, it is highly recommended
    that you update as soon as possible.

    <h4>10.1 051 cURL       Date: 2021-05-26 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In cURL-7.77.0, three security vulnerabilities were fixed. The first one
    only applies to Windows systems and is therefore irrelevant to LFS. The 
    second vulnerability allows the stack to be disclosed to a remote attacker
    while a TELNET session is in progress. The third vulnerability, which is
    rated as high, allows for remote code execution on HTTPS sessions. The
    TELNET vulnerability is due to an issue with an uninitialized variable,
    and the remote code execution vulnerability is due to a use-after-free.
    This vulnerability has been called the "TLS session caching disaster", and
    instructions for achieving remote code execution have been released to the
    public. Therefore, it is suggested that you update immediately. Note that
    this only applies to systems which use OpenSSL as their SSL backend, which
    is the default configuration in BLFS.

    <p>In libX11-1.7.1, a security vulnerability was fixed that allows through
    command injection through the libX11 API protocol. This vulnerability exists
    in the XLookupColor function, intended for server-side color lookup. 
    The flaw consists of a client being allowed to send color names with a name
    longer than the maximum size allowed, and also the maximum packet size for
    normalized packets. This then allows for the X server authorization process
    to be disabled completely, as the end of the packet is then considered a
    protocol command. This vulnerability has existed since February of 1986.
    This vulnerability has been rated at a 9.3 CRITICAL on the CVSS scale,

    <h4>10.1 049 postgresql Date: 2021-05-18 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In PostgreSQL-13.3, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for memory disclosure as well as a buffer overrun caused by an integer
    overflow in array subscripting calculations. The buffer overrun could allow
    for authenticated database users to write arbitrary bytes to a wide area of
    server memory. The memory disclosure vulnerabilities both allow for an
    attacker to read arbitrary bytes of server memory when executing
    UPDATE...RETURNING commands in partitioned-tables, and when executing
    INSERT...ON CONFLICT... DO UPDATE commands on a purpose crafted table.
    In the default PostgreSQL configuration, any authenticated database user
    can create the prerequisite objects and complete this attack at will.
    Users lacking the CREATE and TEMPORARY privileges on all databases and the
    CREATE privilege on all schemas cannot exploit this attack.

    <h4>10.1 045 Samba         Date: 2021-05-12 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In Samba-4.14.4, a security vulnerability was fixed that allows for
    users to have unauthorized access to information, as well as the ability
    for users to modify/delete files from shares that they should not have
    access to. The underlying cause of this vulnerability is an out-of-bounds
    read that sometimes occurs when mapping Windows group identities (SIDs) into
    Unix group IDs (gids). The code that handles this could read data beyond
    the end of an array in the case that a negative cache entry had been added
    to the cache. This would then cause the conversion code to return those
    values into the process token that stores the group membership of a user.
    This vulnerability was originally spotted at Linkoping University, where
    a user was found deleting files from a network share that they were not
    supposed to have access to. If you are using the Samba file server to share
    files, it is suggested that you update immediately. Other impacts include
    potential server crashes, as well as impacts to data confidentiality and
    integrity.

    <p>Eight vulnerabilities have been found in the rust standard library before
    1.52.0, or in crates which use it. One of the critical CVEs was raised as
    'before 1.53.0', but the fix has been backported to 1.52.0.</p>
    <p>For the general case (where static libraries are used and a variety of
    crates might be built) the advice is to update both rust and all the packages
    which use it.</p>
    <p>For BLFS with its limited number of crates which use rust, it can be shown
    (e.g. by removing the /opt/rustc symlink) that the built programs do not use
    the standard library at runtime), and therefore the vulnerabilities are
    assumed to have been at compile time. Nevertheless, the incorrect code has
    been available and it may be that the resulting programs can do incorrect
    things. The safest advice is to update rust and then rebuild (or update) all
    the packages which use it.</p>

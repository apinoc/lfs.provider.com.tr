    <p>BLFS-10.0 was released on 2020-09-01</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">This page is in alphabetical order of packages,
    and if a package has multiple advisories the newer come first.</p>

    <p> The links at the end of each item point to fuller details which have
    links to the
    released <!-- change to 'released' when links in consolidated are changed
    after a release -->
    books.</p>

    <p>In general, the severity is taken from upstream, if supplied, or from
    NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/) if an analysis is available there,
    but individual severity ratings at NVD can change over time. If no other
    information is available, 'High' will normally be assumed.</p>

    <!-- After a release, copy for next book version, leave just template stuff
     and initially say "There are no known vulnerabilities." -->

<!-- start of list: Order is Alphabetic by package name (create multiple entries
     if more than one package is involved, e.g. for those firefox updates which
     also require JS to be updated.  Within each package, latest update first

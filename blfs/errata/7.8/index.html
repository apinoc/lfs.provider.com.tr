     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 7.8</h1>

     <ul>
       <li>In firefox, the new GConf dependency was omitted. To build without
       that package, add the following line to the mozconfig: <br>
       ac_add_options --disable-gconf</li> 

       <li>If you have installed yelp, but in gnome applications 'help' cannot
       find the contents (e.g. using the F1 key), run 'update-desktop-database'.
       </li>

       <li>For anybody building the biblatex-biber perl module dependencies by
       hand, List::MoreUtils (and therefore Mozilla::CA) and LWP::Protocol::https
       were omitted from the dependencies in error, although they are all
       mentioned on the perl modules page.</li>
     <!--
       <li>There are no current known errata for BLFS 7.8.</li> 
       <li>There are several references throughout the book to $QTDIR.
       This reference should be $QT4DIR.  Packages that are affected
       include Grantlee, Libdbusmenu-qt, Qca, Qjson, Polkit-Qt,
       Automoc4, Phonon, and Akonadi.  The reference at the end of the page 
       'Starting KDE' should also be $QT4DIR. </li>

       <li>A few dependencies have been overlooked for OpenJDK. Attr and gtk+2
       (instead of gtk+3) are required. And with the written instructions, nss
       is recommended.</li>

       <li>In the Xorg Fonts instructions "Install all of the packages by
       running...", the line "rm -rf $packagedir" may exit with error and
       stop the build, if not executed as root. One fix is to add "as_root" at
       the beginning of the line.</li>

       <li>In the Qt5 dependencies, ruby should be added as an optional
       dependency.  It is required to build QtWebkit</li>

     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <p>A few packages, such as openssl, are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox, every
     new release, and sometimes point releases (like firefox-41.0.2) include(s)
     security fixes. But in many cases the fixes are not documented as security
     issues.</pa>
     <ul>
       <li>firefox-41.0.2 fixes what is apparently CVE-2015-7184: the fetch() API
       did not correctly implement the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
       specification, allowing a malicious page to access private data from other
        origins.</li>
     </ul>

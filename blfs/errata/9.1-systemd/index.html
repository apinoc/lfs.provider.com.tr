     <h1>Errata for BLFS systemd Version 9.1</h1>

     <!-- Editors: Do not remove this entry, just comment it out. -->

     <!--<ul>
       <li>There are no current errata for blfs-9.1-systemd.</li>
     </ul>-->

     <ul>
       <li>The md5sum for the package xf86-video-intel-20200218.tar.xz is
           incorrect.  It should be 3bffa543c146e801a7f2674865c34331.</li>

       <li>The md5sum for the package  cairo-1.17.2+f93fc72c03e.tar.xz is
           incorrect.  It should be 23a9420780f74ad0ca1e9885e53ee022.</li>
       <!--<li>There are no current errata for blfs-9.1-systemd.</li>-->

       <li>In kdenlive, a problem was discovered where Kdenlive would
           crash with a segmentation fault anytime that it was closed, which would
           corrupt any project files that were open as well as the source media.
           To fix this, please apply the patch in
           <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/patches/downloads/kdenlive/kdenlive-19.12.2-segfault_fix-1.patch">
           kdenlive-19.12.2 segmentation fault patch</a> to your source tree.</li>

       <li>In the seamonkey page, it was discovered that the symlink to place
           the seamonkey.png icon in /usr/share/pixmaps was incorrect. Use the
           following command to fix it:
           ln -sfv /usr/lib/seamonkey-2.53.1/chrome/icons/default/default128.png \
                   /usr/share/pixmaps/seamonkey.png</li>
      
       <li>In the Plasma page, it was discovered that the filename for
           "plasmawayland.desktop" was incorrect. In the instructions for when
           $KF5_PREFIX isn't /usr, change plasma.desktop to plasmawayland.desktop
           when creating the symbolic link in /usr/share/wayland-sessions.</li>

       <li>In the Rustc page, the grep command to report the total number of
           tests was incorrect because where a suite only runs 1 test if reports
           it is running 1 test and the grep looked for tests. That is why the
           number of tests has not added up ever since the rustc tests were added
           to BLFS. Now fixed, using an egrep command.</li>

       <li>It was discovered that after BLFS 9.1 was released, the version of
           PDFBox and FontBox used in fop was no longer available. Please use
           the 2.0.19 version of these packages instead. The md5sum for
           pdfbox-2.0.19.jar is 1c085389e055c957b07c25c8443de728. The md5sum
           for fontbox-2.0.19.jar is 74b3b8ee7eef40b0aff5ca5aa07d96f7.</li>

       <li>The configuration section for iptables was accidentally omitted
           from BLFS 9.1. To view the configuration section, please view
           <a href="../../view/systemd/postlfs/iptables.html">iptables-1.8.4</a>.</li>

       <li>In texlive from source, the tlpdb database is not shipped with the
           source in years after 2018. That means that 'texdoc' does not work in
           the 9.1 book. For TL2020 this has now been fixed in the svn book
           <a href="../../view/systemd/pst/texlive.html">texlive-20200406</a> but
           if you wish to fix this in the 2019 release you can download the
           texlive-20190410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz file from tug's historic/2019
           directory.</li>

       <li>The url for popt has been dead for a while, and the blfs team
           was providing the package on
           <a href="http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org">anduin</a>. Now 
           upstream has provided a new
           <a href="http://ftp.rpm.org/mirror/popt/">download url</a> too.
           according to this <a href=
           "http://lists.rpm.org/pipermail/rpm-announce/2020-May/000077.html">
            mail</a>, upstream is also preparing a new release.</li>

       <li>In dvisvgm the dependency links to brotli (required) and woff2
           (recommended) were accidentally omitted.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available in the 
        <a href="../../view/systemd/">development version of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <!-- Editors: Do not remove this entry, just comment it out. -->

       <li>After release, a serious security flaw was found in the DTLS
          implementation in GnuTLS. Another security flaw was found in 
          the way that GnuTLS processed session tickets. A root certificate
          expired on 5/30/2020 that also broke several websites because GnuTLS
          didn't have the logic available to switch to an alternate certificate
          with an identical private key. To fix these vulnerabilities, update 
          to GnuTLS-3.6.14 or later using the instructions in

     <h1>Errata for BLFS systemd Version 8.1</h1>

     <ul>
       <li>There are no current known errata for BLFS 8.1-systemd.</li>

<!--
       <li>The details of microcode updates, particularly for late loading,
       reflected how things used to be several kernel versions ago. This
       has been updated for the 4.9 kernel in the development version of the
       book.</li>

       <li>Firefox by default requires BOTH gtk+-3 and gtk+-2.</li>

       <li>In 'Tuning Fontconfig' the example under 'Hinting and Anti-aliasing
       has a spurious fonts.conf in the initial mkdir.</li>
-->
     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages, such as openssl, are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available
     in the 
     <a href="../../view/systemd/">development version of the book.</a>

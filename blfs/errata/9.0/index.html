     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 9.0</h1>
     
     <ul>
       <li>After release, a problem was discovered in BIND where the instructions
       used in the book would result in a nonexistent rndc.conf file. To fix this,
       run "rndc-confgen -a -b 512 -t /srv/named" instead of
       "rndc-confgen -r /dev/urandom -b 512 &gt; /etc/rndc.conf". Also, 
       please modify the files to reference /etc/named instead of /etc/namedb.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available in the 
        <a href="../../view/svn/">development version of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <p>After release, three security vulnerabilities were identified in the
     CUPS print server. These are primarily buffer overflow vulnerabilities. To
     fix them, use the instructions in
     <a href="../../view/svn/pst/cups.html">CUPS 2.3.1</a> to upgrade to
     CUPS-2.3.1.</p>

     <p>After release it was discovered that many security fixes for
     unzip-6.0 were present in distros but had not been applied to BLFS.
     To fix these, rebuild unzip using the patch in
     <a href="../..//view/svn/general/unzip.html">unzip-6.0</a>.</p>

     <p>After release the xvid team released a new version that contained
     fixes for "various, long-standing and potentially critical security

     <p>After release, a security flaw was discovered in npm, shipped with
     node.js, that leads to files being overwrited when installing packages.
     These files get overwritten in whatever prefix you are installing node in,
     and can include files in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. This can lead to file
     deletion of files installed by other packages and other damage. Additional
     flaws in the HTTP parser were also found. Please

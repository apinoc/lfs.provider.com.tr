     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages, such as openssl, are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <!--
     <ul>
       <li>firefox-41.0.2 fixes what is apparently CVE-2015-7184: the fetch() API
       did not correctly implement the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
       specification, allowing a malicious page to access private data from other
        origins.</li>

     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 8.3</h1>
     
     <ul>
       <!--<li>There are no current known errata for BLFS 8.3-sysv.</li>-->

       <li>In the instructions for frei0r-plugins, the first instruction should be:
       "sed -i 's/CV_RGB/cv::Scalar/' src/filter/facebl0r/facebl0r.cpp" to
       fix a build problem with the current opencv dependency,</li>
       
       <li>In firefox, the command to build it was truncated to './mach'
       instead of './mach build' - the command explanation was correct.</li>

       <li>In Samba, the Recommended dependency of perl module Parse::Yapp
       was mistakenly commented out.</li>

       <li>On the rustc page, the caution about running tests on AMD Ryzens
       is overstated, and the "mitigation" actually does nothing. The invalid
       opcodes when running the tests on Ryzens are real, but the reboots were
       almost-certainly caused by a triple-fault in the kernel - probably an
       -rc kernel, and no doubt triggered by the invalid opcode.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available
     in the 
     <a href="../../view/svn/">development version of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <p>A vulnerability in texlive's handling of postscript files, applicable
     to all versions from the past several years, has been fixed with a patch
     to the 2018 source in the development book, tested with BLFS-8.1 and
     later. For users of the binary texlive who have not updated since 2018-09-20,
     please do so.</p>

     <p>A vulnerability with available exploits in all recent versions of
     ghostscript has been fixed in the development book by patching gs-9.25.
     The current version of the patch is -2 and the vulnerability applies to
     PDF files as well as postscript.</p>

     <p>A trivially-exploitable local privilege escalation in versions of
     xorg-server since 1.19 has been fixed in 1.20.3.</p>

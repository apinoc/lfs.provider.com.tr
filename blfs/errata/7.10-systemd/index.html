     <h1>Errata for BLFS systemd Version 7.10</h1>

     <ul>
       <li>The instructions for perl module Business::ISBN omitted its recently
       acquired dependency on the Mojolicious module.</li>
       <li>In texlive (from source) the ldconfig instruction has been misplaced
       since June 2015, it should come before 'make texlinks'.</li>
     <!--
       <li>In the Qt5 dependencies, ruby should be added as an optional
       dependency.  It is required to build QtWebkit</li>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages, such as openssl, are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available
     in the 
     <a href="../../view/systemd/">development verision of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <p>For texlive, see the "Now, or if returning here because you were advised,
     fix a new vulnerability." command at the end of the texlive source page. This
     also applies to the binary if you have installed it before early December 2016
     and not run tlupdate.</p>

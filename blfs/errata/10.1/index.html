       <li>In OpenSSH, there was a bug that could lead to sshd rejecting
           connections on some non-x86_64 platforms, such as i686.
           This problem is due to the seccomp syscall filtering functionality
           added to OpenSSH-8.4p1. To fix this, run the command in this
           <a href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/arc/lfs-support/2021-03/msg00065.html">Mailing List Post</a>.</li>
       <li>The version of libgweather shipped with BLFS 10.1 violates the
           Norweigan Meteorology Society's API terms of service. Update to
           libgweather-3.38.2 using the existing instructions in BLFS 10.1 to
           fix this problem.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>Details of Security Advisories for this version of BLFS are now
     at <a href="../../advisories/10.1.html">Advisories for BLFS 10.1</a><p>

<!-- COMMENT THE OLD ADVISORIES IN THE ERRATA: PLEASE NOW UPDATE advisories/10.1.html
     AND and advisories/consolidated.html-->

     <p>A few packages are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available in the 
        <a href="../../view/svn/">development version of the book.</a>

     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 8.1</h1>

     <ul>
       <li>There are no current known errata for BLFS 8.1-sysv.</li>
       <!--<li>On the libpng page there is a misspelled library name.  The

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages, such as openssl, are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available
     in the 
     <a href="../../view/svn/">development version of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <p>For texlive, see the "Now, or if returning here because you were advised,
     fix a new vulnerability." command at the end of the texlive source page. This

     and not run tlupdate.</p>

       did not correctly implement the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
       specification, allowing a malicious page to access private data from other
        origins.</li>

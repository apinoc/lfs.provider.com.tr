       <h2>Miscellaneous Errata</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>
             <p>It has been reported that the Berkeley DB backend engine in the
             MySQL package is now obsolete, and has been completely removed
             from later versions of MySQL. As the Berkeley DB backend isn't
             required (there are newer, more robust engines), you can feel free
             to remove the --with-berkeley-db parameter from the MySQL
             configure command.</p>
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>For Firefox and possibly Seamonkey, there has been at least one 
             report that libcURL is a required runtime dependency for the Adobe 10 
             flash plugin.
             </p>
           </li>
           
           <li>
             <p>There is a critial security bug in imlib2-1.4.0.  It is important 
             that all users update to imlib2-1.4.2.  Instructions for that package
             are in the development book, 
             http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/imlib2.html.
             </p>
           
           <li>
             <p>When building HAL-0.5.9.1, an uncompressed /usr/share/pci.ids file
             is required.  The default instructions for PCI Utilities-2.2.3 
             create a compressed /usr/share/pci.ids.gz file.  Before building 
             HAL-0.5.9.1, uncompress /usr/share/pci.ids.gz as the root user: </p>

             <code>gunzip /usr/share/pci.ids.gz</code>
            
           </li>

           <li>
             <p>When building SANE, make sure that non-scanner USB devices 
             (e.g., hubs) in /dev/bus/usb have 0664 permissions (i.e., are 
             readable), otherwise scanner access will fail. This
             requires modification of the 25-lfs.rules file in 
             /etc/udev/rules.d installed by LFS 6.3.  To do this, 
             add a MODE="0664" to the line that starts with SUBSYSTEM=="usb".</p>
           </li>

         </ul>

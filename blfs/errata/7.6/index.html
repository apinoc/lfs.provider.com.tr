     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 7.6</h1>

     <ul>
       <li>There are no current known errata for BLFS 7.6.</li>
     <!--
       <li>There are several references throughout the book to $QTDIR.
       This reference should be $QT4DIR.  Packages that are affected
       include Grantlee, Libdbusmenu-qt, Qca, Qjson, Polkit-Qt,
       Automoc4, Phonon, and Akonadi.  The reference at the end of the page 
       'Starting KDE' should also be $QT4DIR. </li>

       <li>A few dependencies have been overlooked for OpenJDK. Attr and gtk+2
       (instead of gtk+3) are required. And with the written instructions, nss
       is recommended.</li>

       <li>In the Xorg Fonts instructions "Install all of the packages by
       running...", the line "rm -rf $packagedir" may exit with error and
       stop the build, if not executed as root. One fix is to add "as_root" at
       the beginning of the line.</li>

       <li>In the Qt5 dependencies, ruby should be added as an optional
       dependency.  It is required to build QtWebkit</li>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><p>There here are several security fixes available to WebKitGTK+2.4.x.
             All users should update their current version according to the instructions
            at:<br/><br/>

       <li><b>Important.</b> There is a critical security flaw in 
       openssl versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f.  Use the most current

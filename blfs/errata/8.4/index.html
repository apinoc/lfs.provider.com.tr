     <h1>Errata for BLFS Version 8.4</h1>
     
     <ul>
       <li>After release, a problem was discovered with LXDE/LXPanel where
       right clicking on the taskbar to close a program would sometimes cause
       LXPanel to crash with a General Protection Fault. To fix this, upgrade
       to the latest version: 
         <a href="../../view/svn/lxde/lxpanel.html">
         http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/lxde/lxpanel.html</a>.
       </li>

       <li>After release, a security problem regarding the mprotect() syscall
       defined in libseccomp was discovered. Upstream released a new version to
       solve this problem. The BLFS team recommends upgrading to the latest
       version:
         <a href="../../view/svn/general/libseccomp.html">
         http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/libseccomp.html</a>.
       </li>

       <li>A problem was uncovered with Libreoffice Writer and documents
       longer than 20 pages. This was fixed in the latest upstream release.
       To fix this problem, upgrade to the latest version:
         <a href="../../view/svn/xsoft/libreoffice.html">
            http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/xsoft/libreoffice.html</a>
       </li>

       <li>On May 4th, 2019, Mozilla let a certificate expire that provided 
       signatures for all add-ons and extensions in Firefox. In order to fix this
       and possible SSL problems, the BLFS team recommends updating to Firefox
       66.0.5 or later as soon as possible, before the temporary fix expires.
       No dependency updates are required. To upgrade, use the instructions here:
       <a href="../../view/svn/xsoft/firefox.html">
          http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/xsoft/firefox.html</a>
       </li>

       <li>After release, a problem was discovered with WebKitGTK+'s website that
       prevented the version of WebKitGTK+ shipped with BLFS 8.4 from downloading.
       The BLFS team recommends using the latest 2.24.x versions because they are
       API and ABI compatible, and require no modifications to the instructions.</li>

     <h2>Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
     
     <p>A few packages are good at reporting that a new
     release fixes a vulnerability. For some others, such as firefox,
     virtually every new release includes security fixes. But in many cases
     the fixes are not documented as security issues.</p>
     
     <p>Updates to the packages in the book may be available
     in the 
     <a href="../../view/svn/">development version of the book.</a>
     </p>

     <p>A vulnerability in kf5's kcodecs package now has a fix for 
     CVE-2013-0779.  See the build instructions that add
     a sed to the script in ../../view/svn/kde/krameworks5.html.
     </p>

     <p>Two critical zero-day security vulnerabilities were discovered in
     Firefox and Thunderbird. The BLFS team recommends upgrading to the new
     versions immediately. See the build instructions in
     ../../view/svn/xsoft/firefox.html and
     ../../view/svn/xsoft/thunderbird.html.
     </p>

     <p>After release, thirteen vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache
     HTTPD. These include two privilege escalation vulnreabilities and
     one access control bypass. The BLFS team recommends upgrading to the
     new version ASAP. See the build instructions in
     ../../view/svn/server/apache.html.
     </p>

     <p>In May 2018, a vulnerability dubbed "ZombieLoad" was discovered in Intel
     CPUs. In order to fix this, apply the microcode using the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/postlfs/firmware.html.</p>

     <p>Post-release, critical vulnerabilities were discovered in Samba, with all
     versions from 4.0.x to 4.10.3 impacted. These allow for arbitrary file overwrite,
     authentication bypass, password hash leaks, unauthorized modification/reading
     of files, and symlink traversal. The BLFS team recommends upgrading to the 4.10.4
     release of Samba as soon as possible, using the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/basicnet/samba.html.</p>

     <p>Post-release, a vulnerability was discovered in GLib that allows
     modification of files and ACLs through the GIO subsystem. This was fixed
     by clamping down on permissions in version GLib-2.60.4. The BLFS team
     recommends updating to GLib-2.60.4 or later as soon as possible,
     using the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/general/glib2.html.</p>

     <p>Post-release, a vulnerability was discovered in D-Bus that allows
     for authentication bypass through an open D-Bus socket. To fix this,
     upgrade to version 1.12.16 or later using the instructions at
     ../../view/svn/general/dbus.xml.</p>

     <p>In June,, a security problem with vim was discovered: Remote attackers can
     execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline. 
     This has been fixed in version 8.1.1365, see the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/postlfs/editors/vim.html.</p>

     <p>In June, 23 security vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution,
     sandbox escape, URL forging, denial of service, and remote modification of
     memory were discovered in QtWebEngine. This has been fixed by updating to
     Qt/QtWebEngine 5.12.4, and upgrading ASAP is recommended. See the instructions
     in ../../view/svn/x/qt5.html.</p>

     <p>In June, 3 security vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code
     execution, unauthorized modification of data, and information disclosure
     were discovered in WebKitGTK+ before 2.24.2. The BLFS team recommends
     upgrading to WebKitGTK+-2.24.2 using the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/x/webkitgtk.html.</p>

     <p>In June, more 0-days were discovered in Thunderbird and Firefox. The ones
     in Thunderbird allow for a repeatable crash and subsequent profile corruption
     simply by receiving a .ics file because of the way that Thunderbird processes
     mails while it downloads them (indexing attachments and contents). The ones
     in Firefox allow for Arbitrary Code Execution through the JavaScript and
     IPC layers. The BLFS team recommends upgrading to Thunderbird-60.7.2 and
     Firefox-67.0.4 immediately, using the instructions in
     ../../view/svn/xsoft/thunderbird.html and ../../view/svn/xsoft/firefox.html.</p>

     <p>In August, a 0-day vulnerability was released to the public without prior
     contact with the KDE developers. This bug has been dubbed CVE-2019-14744, and
     allows for arbitrary code execution through any .desktop or .directory file
     that may exist on the system (at least that Baloo can index). In addition,
     it can be triggered through Ark or a file manager under a Plasma environment.
     To fix this, apply the following patch to your KConfig sources and rebuild
     (It has been tested against 5.53.0 as well as 5.60.0):
     http://linuxfromscratch.org/patches/downloads/kconfig/kconfig-5.60.0-cve_2019_14744-1.patch</p>

<!--
     <p>A vulnerability with available exploits in all recent versions of
     ghostscript has been fixed in the development book by patching gs-9.25.
     The current version of the patch is -2 and the vulnerability applies to
     PDF files as well as postscript.</p>

     <p>A trivially-exploitable local privilege escalation in versions of
     xorg-server since 1.19 has been fixed in 1.20.3.</p>

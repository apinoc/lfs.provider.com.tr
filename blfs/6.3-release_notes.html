      <h1>BLFS 6.3 Release Notes</h1>
         <p>BLFS version 6.3 is the complement to the LFS 6.3 book. It has been
         18 months since the last release of BLFS and almost 12 months since LFS-6.3
         was released. Though we would like to release BLFS versions as quickly as
         possible after an LFS release, this version lagged a bit due to Editor
         inactivity. However, early on in 2008 several new Editors were brought on
         board which helped stimulate a flurry of activity.  Many new packages have
         been introduced in the 6.3 version, as well as many updates, refinements and
         additions to the existing packages.</p>

         <p>The BLFS book now provides build and configuration instructions for
         almost 500 packages (many more than that if you want to count each individual
         package in the autotooled X Window instructions). Some of the new packages
         introduced in this version are:
         Dash, ksh, D-Bus bindings, Wireshark (formerly named Ethereal), rxvt-unicode,
         Gutenprint (formerly name Gimp-Print), Pidgin (formerly name Gaim), GnuTLS
         (and many of its dependencies), Qt version 4.x, GnuPG version 2.x, and
         Amarok. Major updates include GNOME-2.18.3 (with several new GNOME packages),
         KDE-3.5.9, Firefox-2.x, Thunderbird-2.x, and most (if not all) of the
         mainline server packages. As always, the list of packages that have been
         upgraded or added as well as configuration and build command changes are
         annotated in the ChangeLog.</p>

         <p>As always, the main thrust of BLFS development will be to support
         the changes in the current LFS development book, but we're releasing this
         version of BLFS so that builders of the stable LFS book can continue on
         into BLFS with known good instructions that should be 100% compatible to
         provide a semi current and very stable Linux platform.</p>

         <p>Enjoy!</p>

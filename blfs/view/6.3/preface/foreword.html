      <p>
        BLFS version 6.3 is the complement to the LFS 6.3 book. It has been
        18 months since the last release of BLFS and almost 12 months since
        LFS-6.3 was released. Though we would like to release BLFS versions
        as quickly as possible after an LFS release, this version lagged a
        bit due to Editor inactivity. However, early on in 2008 several new
        Editors were brought on board which helped stimulate a flurry of
        activity. Many new packages have been introduced in the 6.3 version,
        as well as many updates, refinements and additions to the existing
        packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BLFS book now provides build and configuration instructions for
        almost 500 packages (many more than that if you want to count each
        individual package in the autotooled X Window instructions). Some of
        the new packages introduced in this version are: Dash, ksh, D-Bus
        bindings, Wireshark (formerly named Ethereal), rxvt-unicode,
        Gutenprint (formerly name Gimp-Print), Pidgin (formerly name Gaim),
        GnuTLS (and many of its dependencies), Qt version 4.x, GnuPG version
        2.x, and Amarok. Major updates include GNOME-2.18.3 (with several new
        GNOME packages), KDE-3.5.9, Firefox-2.x, Thunderbird-2.x, and most
        (if not all) of the mainline server packages. As always, the list of
        packages that have been upgraded or added as well as configuration
        and build command changes are annotated in the <a class="xref" href=
        "../introduction/changelog.html" title="Change Log">Change Log</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, the main thrust of BLFS development will be to support the
        changes in the current LFS development book, but we're releasing this
        version of BLFS so that builders of the stable LFS book can continue
        on into BLFS with known good instructions that should be 100%
        compatible to provide a semi current and very stable Linux platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy!

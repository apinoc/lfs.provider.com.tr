            Package Management

        <p>
          Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book.
          A Package Manager allows tracking the installation of files making
          it easy to remove and upgrade packages. And before you begin to
          wonder, NO&mdash;this section does not talk about any particular
          package manager, nor does it recommend one. What it provides is a
          roundup of the more popular techniques and how they work. The
          perfect package manager for you may be among these techniques or
          may be a combination of two or more of these techniques. This
          section briefly mentions issues that may arise when upgrading
          packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some reasons why no package manager is mentioned in LFS or BLFS:

                Dealing with package management takes the focus away from the

              Upgrade Issues
            </h2>

          <p>
            A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions when
            they are released. Generally the instructions in the LFS and BLFS
            Book can be used to upgrade to the newer versions. Here are some
            points that you should be aware of when upgrading packages,
            especially on a running system.
          </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If one of the toolchain packages (<span class=
                  "application">Glibc</span>, <span class=
                  "application">GCC</span> or <span class=
                  "application">Binutils</span>) needs to be upgraded to a
                  newer minor version, it is safer to rebuild LFS. Though you
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to get
                  by rebuilding all the packages in their dependency order,
                  we do not recommend it. For example, if glibc-2.2.x needs
                  to be updated to glibc-2.3.x, it is safer to rebuild. For
                  micro version updates, a simple reinstallation usually
                  works, but is not guaranteed. For example, upgrading from
                  glibc-2.3.4 to glibc-2.3.5 will not usually cause any
                  problems.

              <li>
                <p>
                  If a package containing a shared library is updated, and if
                  the name of the library changes, then all the packages
                  dynamically linked to the library need to be recompiled to
                  link against the newer library. (Note that there is no
                  correlation between the package version and the name of the
                  library.) For example, consider a package foo-1.2.3 that
                  installs a shared library with name <tt class=
                  "filename">libfoo.so.1</tt>. Say you upgrade the package to
                  a newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared library
                  with name <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. In this
                  case, all packages that are dynamically linked to
                  <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.1</tt> need to be recompiled
                  to link against <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. Note
                  that you should not remove the previous libraries until the
                  dependent packages are recompiled.

                <p>
                  If you are upgrading a running system, be on the lookout
                  for packages that use <span><strong class=
                  "command">cp</strong></span> instead of
                  <span><strong class="command">install</strong></span> to
                  install files. The latter command is usually safer if the
                  executable or library is already loaded in memory.

              Package Management Techniques

          <p>
            The following are some common package management techniques.
            Before making a decision on a package manager, do some research
            on the various techniques, particularly the drawbacks of the
            particular scheme.

              Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not
              find the need for a package manager because they know the
              packages intimately and know what files are installed by each
              package. Some users also do not need any package management
              because they plan on rebuilding the entire system when a
              package is changed.

              This is a simplistic package management that does not need any
              extra package to manage the installations. Each package is
              installed in a separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1
              is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt> and
              a symlink is made from <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt>
              to <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt>. When installing
              a new version foo-1.2, it is installed in <tt class=
              "filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.2</tt> and the previous symlink is
              replaced by a symlink to the new version.
            </p>
            <p>
              The environment variables such as those mentioned in <a href=
              "beyond.html" title="Going Beyond BLFS">the section called
              &ldquo;Going Beyond BLFS&rdquo;</a> need to be expanded to
              include <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt>. For more than a
              few packages, this scheme becomes unmanageable.
            </p>

                    Package Management
                  </h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is a variation of the previous package management
              technique. Each package is installed similar to the previous
              scheme. But instead of making the symlink, each file is
              symlinked into the <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> hierarchy.
              This removes the need to expand the environment variables.
              Though the symlinks can be created by the user to automate the
              creation, many package managers have been written using this
              approach. A few of the popular ones are Stow, Epkg, Graft, and
              Depot.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation needs to be faked, so that the package thinks
              that it is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> though
              in reality it is installed in the <tt class=
              "filename">/usr/pkg</tt> hierarchy. Installing in this manner
              is not usually a trivial task. For example, consider that you
              are installing a package libfoo-1.1. The following instructions
              may not install the package properly:
            </p>
            <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
            "command">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1
make
make install</kbd></pre>
            <p>
              The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not
              link to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package
              that links against libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
              <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt>
              instead of <tt class="filename">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt> as
              you would expect. The correct approach is to use <tt class=
              "envar">DESTDIR</tt> strategy to fake installation of the
              package. This approach works as follows:
            </p>
            <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
            "command">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</kbd></pre>
            <p>
              Most of the packages do support this approach, but there are
              some which do not. For the non-compliant packages, you may
              either need to manually install the package, or you may find
              that it is easier to install some problematic packages into
              <tt class="filename">/opt</tt>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
            <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
            <p>
              In this technique, a file is timestamped before the
              installation of the package. After the installation, a simple
              use of the <span><strong class="command">find</strong></span>
              command with the appropriate options can generate a log of all
              the files installed after the timestamp file was created. A
              package manager written with this approach is install-log.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has
              two drawbacks. If during installation, the files are installed
              with any timestamp other than the current time, those files
              will not be tracked by the package manager. Also, this scheme
              can only be used when one package is installed at a time. The
              logs are not reliable if two packages are being installed on
              two different consoles.

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              In this approach, a library is preloaded before installation.
              During installation, this library tracks the packages that are
              being installed by attaching itself to various executables such
              as <span><strong class="command">cp</strong></span>,
              <span><strong class="command">install</strong></span>,
              <span><strong class="command">mv</strong></span> and tracking
              the system calls that modify the filesystem. For this approach
              to work, all the executables need to be dynamically linked
              without the suid or sgid bit. Preloading the library may cause
              some unwanted side-effects during installation. Therefore, do
              perform some tests to ensure that the package manager does not
              break anything and logs all the appropriate files.

            <p>
              In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a
              separate tree as described in the Symlink style package
              management. After the installation, a package archive is
              created using the installed files. This archive is then used to
              install the package either on the local machine or can even be
              used to install the package on other machines.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is used by most of the package managers found in
              the commercial distributions. Examples of package managers that
              follow this approach are RPM, pkg-utils, Debian's apt, and
              Gentoo's Portage system.

              This scheme, unique to LFS, was devised by Matthias Benkmann,
              and is available from the <a href=
              "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/"><span class=
              "url">Hints Project</span></a>. In this scheme, each package is
              installed as a separate user into the standard locations. Files
              belonging to a package are easily identified by checking the
              user ID. The features and shortcomings of this approach are too
              complex to describe in this section. For the details please see
              the hint at <a href=

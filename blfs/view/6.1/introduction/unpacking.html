          Notes on Building Software
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Those people who have built an LFS system will be aware of the
        general principles of downloading and unpacking software. We will
        however repeat some of that information here for those new to
        building their own software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of installation instructions contains a URL from which you
        can download the package. We do however keep a selection of patches
        available via HTTP. These are referenced as needed in the
        installation instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can keep the source files anywhere you like, we assume that
        you have unpacked them and unzipped any required patches into
        <tt class="filename">/usr/src</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>clean source tree</em></span> each time.
        This means that if you have had an error, it's usually best to delete
        the source tree and re-unpack it <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>before</em></span> trying again. This obviously
        doesn't apply if you're an advanced user used to hacking <tt class=
        "filename">Makefile</tt>s and C code, but if in doubt, start from a
        clean tree.
      </p>

            Building Software as an Unprivileged (non-root) User
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The golden rule of Unix System Administration is to use your
          superpowers only when necessary. Hence, BLFS recommends that you
          build software as an unprivileged user and only become the
          <tt class="systemitem">root</tt> user when installing the software.
          This philosophy is followed in all the packages in this book.
          Unless otherwise specified, all instructions should be executed as
          an unprivileged user. The book will advise you on instructions that
          need <tt class="systemitem">root</tt> privileges.

            Unpacking the Software
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          If a file is in <tt class="filename">.tar</tt> format and
          compressed, it is unpacked by running one of the following
          commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">tar -xvf filename.tar.gz
tar -xvf filename.tgz
tar -xvf filename.tar.Z
tar -xvf filename.tar.bz2</kbd></pre>

          <div class="admonhead">

          <div class="admonbody">
            <p>
              You may omit using the <tt class="option">v</tt> parameter in
              the commands shown above and below if you wish to suppress the
              verbose listing of all the files in the archive as they are
              extracted. This can help speed up the extraction as well as
              make any errors produced during the extraction more obvious to
              you.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can also use a slightly different method:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Finally, you sometimes need to be able to unpack patches which are
          generally not in <tt class="filename">.tar</tt> format. The best
          way to do this is to copy the patch file to <tt class=
          "filename">/usr/src</tt> and then run one of the following commands
          depending on whether the file is a <tt class="filename">.gz</tt> or
          <tt class="filename">.bz2</tt> file:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">gunzip -v patchname.gz
bunzip2 -v patchname.bz2</kbd></pre>

            Verifying File Integrity Using 'md5sum'
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and
          complete, many package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the
          files. To verify the md5sum of the downloaded files, download both
          the file and the corresponding md5sum file to the same directory
          (preferably from different on-line locations), and (assuming
          <tt class="filename">file.md5sum</tt> is the md5sum file
          downloaded) run the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">md5sum -c file.md5sum</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          If there are any errors, they will be reported. Note that the BLFS
          book includes md5sums for all the source files also. To use the
          BLFS supplied md5sums, you can create a <tt class=
          "filename">file.md5sum</tt> (place the md5sum data and the exact
          name of the downloaded file on the same line of a file, separated
          by white space) and run the command shown above. Alternately,
          simply run the command shown below and compare the output to the
          md5sum data shown in the BLFS book.
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">md5sum <em class=

            Creating Log Files During Installation
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead
          of staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or
          warning. Log files are also useful for debugging and keeping
          records. The following command allows you to create an installation
          log. Replace <em class="replaceable"><tt>[command]</tt></em> with
          the command you intend to execute.
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">( <em class=
        "replaceable"><tt>[command]</tt></em> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee compile.log &amp;&amp; exit $PIPESTATUS )</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          <tt class="option">2&gt;&amp;1</tt> redirects error messages to the
          same location as standard output. The <span><strong class=
          "command">tee</strong></span> command allows viewing of the output
          while logging the results to a file. The parentheses around the
          command run the entire command in a subshell and finally the
          <span><strong class="command">exit $PIPESTATUS</strong></span>
          command ensures the result of the <em class=
          "replaceable"><tt>[command]</tt></em> is returned as the result and
          not the result of the <span><strong class=
          "command">tee</strong></span> command.

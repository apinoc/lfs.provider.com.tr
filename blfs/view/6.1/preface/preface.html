        <p>
          Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I
          noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things
          beyond the base LFS system. At the time, the only assistance
          specifically offered relating to LFS were the LFS hints (<a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints"><span class=
          "url">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints</span></a>). Most of
          the LFS hints are extremely good and well written but I (and
          others) could still see a need for more comprehensive help to go
          Beyond LFS - hence BLFS.
        </p>
        <p>
          BLFS aims to be more than the LFS-hints converted to XML although
          much of our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors
          write both hints and the relevant BLFS sections. We hope that we
          can provide you with enough information to not only manage to build
          your system up to what you want, whether it be a web server or a
          multimedia desktop system, but also that you will learn a lot about
          system configuration as you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks as ever go to everyone in the LFS/BLFS community; especially
          those who have contributed instructions, written text, answered
          questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask
          questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun
          on #lfs at irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details
          about all of these in the <a href=
          "../introduction/introduction.html">Introduction</a> section of the
          book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy using BLFS.

          I still remember how I found the BLFS project and started using the
          instructions that were completed at the time. I could not believe
          how wonderful it was to get an application up and running very
          quickly, with explanations as to why things were done a certain
          way. Unfortunately, for me, it wasn't long before I was opening
          applications that had nothing more than "To be done" on the page. I
          did what most would do, I waited for someone else to do it. It
          wasn't too long before I am looking through <span class=
          "application">Bugzilla</span> for something easy to do. As with any
          learning experience, the definition of what was easy kept changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We still encourage you to become involved as BLFS is never really
          finished. Contributing or just using, we hope you enjoy your BLFS
          experience.

          The BLFS project is a natural progression of LFS. Together, these
          projects provide a unique resource for the Open Source Community.
          They take the mystery out of the process of building a complete,
          functional software system from the source code contributed by many
          talented individuals throughout the world. They truly allow users
          to implement the slogan "Your distro, your rules."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to continue to provide the best resource available that
          shows you how to integrate many significant Open Source
          applications. Since these applications are constantly updated and
          new applications are developed, this book will never be complete.
          Additionally, there is always room for improvement in explaining
          the nuances of how to install the different packages. To make these
          improvements, we need your feedback. I encourage you to participate
          on the different mailing lists, news groups, and IRC channels to
          help meet these goals.

          </div>
          <p>
            Version 6.0 is a major milestone in the evolution of BLFS. This
            version provides installation instructions for 357 packages and
            an additional 21 sections covering configuration and
            customization of different aspects of your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes and upgrades to the individual packages are detailed in
            the <a href="../introduction/changelog.html">Change Log</a>.
            There you will see literally hundreds of changes made since the
            last edition. In this change log, one name that you will see over
            and over is Randy McMurchy. Without his efforts this release
            would not have been possible. I want to take this opportunity to
            thank him for the hundreds of hours he has worked to produce this
            release. I also want to thank the other editors, both past and
            present, whose insight and effort have made this current version
            possible. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank our
            resident XSL wizard, Manuel Canales Esparcia, whose ability to
            format a complicated document such as BLFS is truly amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two other areas of change that are worthy of note.
            First, the license that BLFS is released under has changed
            significantly. In fact, it is now released under two licenses.
            The first license, the <a href=
            "../appendices/creat-comm.html">Creative Commons License</a>,
            covers the descriptive text in the book. The second, the <a href=
            "../appendices/ac-free-lic.html">Academic Free License v.
            2.1</a>, covers the instructions actually used to build and
            install the packages. These licenses, along with the book itself,
            represent our ongoing commitment to open and free software.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final area of change is the addition of an Index. This
            section of the book is still incomplete, but as the book
            continues to be developed, will become an excellent resource for
            finding programs, libraries, configuration files, and references
            to kernel configuration requirements. I hope you find it useful.

          <p>
            Version 6.1 is an incremental update of BLFS. This version
            continues the tradition of providing an extensive set of
            instructions for extending a basic Linux From Scratch system. The
            instructions in this version of BLFS are based on the LFS 6.1
            Book. As usual, the list of packages that have been upgraded or
            added are in the <a href="../introduction/changelog.html">Change
            Log</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One major accomplishment in this version of the book is the
            completion of the Index. This section is now a relatively
            complete (but not perfect) reference for the components of the
            various packages in the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any task as large and complex as this book, there are bound to
            be errors. The editors of the book are dedicated to keeping the
            book up to date. We appreciate any feedback in helping us to make
            the book as accurate as possible. The best place to provide
            comments is via the mailing list at <a href=

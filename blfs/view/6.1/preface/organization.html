        This book is divided into the following parts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a id="id2564112" name="id2564112"></a>Part I - Introduction

        Configuration and Extra Software
      </h2>
      <p>

        discuss a range of editors, file systems, and shells which aren't
        covered in the main LFS book.
      </p>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <p>
        In this section we cover libraries which are often needed by the rest
        of the book as well as system utilities. Information on Programming
        (including recompiling <span class="application">GCC</span> to
        support its full range of languages) concludes this part.
      </p>
      <h2>

        Network
      </h2>
      <p>

        simple static IP setup given in the main LFS book.
      </p>
      <h2>

      <p>
        <span class="application">GNOME</span> is the main alternative to
        <span class="application">KDE</span> in the Desktop Environment arena
        and we cover both <span class="application">GNOME</span>-1.4 and
        <span class="application">GNOME</span>-2.10 here.

        <a id="id2587082" name="id2587082"></a>Part X - X Software
      </h2>
      <p>

          Deciding what to do next
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now that LFS is complete and you have a bootable system, what do
          you do? The next step is to decide how to use it. Generally, there
          are two broad categories to consider: workstation or server.
          Indeed, these categories are not mutually exclusive. The
          applications needed for each category can be combined onto a single
          system, but let's look at them separately for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server is the simpler category. Generally this consists of a web
          server such as the <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/server/apache.html">
          Apache HTTP Server</a> and a database server such as <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/server/mariadb.html">
          MariaDB</a>. However other services are possible. The operating
          system embedded in a single use device falls into this category.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, a workstation is much more complex. It generally
          requires a graphical user environment such as <a class="ulink"
          href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/lxde/lxde.html">
          LXDE</a>, <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/xfce/xfce.html">XFCE</a>,
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/kde/kde.html">KDE</a>,
          or <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/gnome/gnome.html">
          Gnome</a> (systemd versions of LFS only) based on the <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/installing.html">
          X Window graphical environment</a> and several graphical based
          applications such as the <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/xsoft/firefox.html">
          Firefox web browser</a>, <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/xsoft/thunderbird.html">
          Thunderbird email client</a>, or <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/xsoft/libreoffice.html">
          LibreOffice office suite</a>. These applications require many
          (several hundred depending on desired capabilities) more packages
          of support applications and libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the above, there is a set of applications that are
          suitable for all systems for system management. These applications
          are all in the full BLFS book but are repeated here for
          convenience. Not all packages are needed in all environments. For
          example <a class="xref" href="dhcpcd.html" title=
          "dhcpcd-7.0.8">dhcpcd-7.0.8</a> is not appropriate for a server and
          <a class="xref" href="wireless_tools.html" title=
          "Wireless Tools-29">Wireless Tools-29</a> are normally only useful
          for a laptop system. If you are not sure if a package presented
          here is needed or not, it can either be installed now or later as
          the need arises.

          Working in a partial BLFS environment
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you initially boot into LFS, you have all the internal tools
          to build additional packages. Unfortunately, the user environment
          is quite sparse. There are a couple of ways to improve this:

            Work from the LFS host in chroot
          </h3>
          <p>
            This method provides a complete graphical environment where a
            full featured browser and copy/paste capabilites are available.
            This method allows using applications like the host's version of
            wget to download package sources to a location available when
            working in the chroot envirnment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to properly build packages in chroot, you will also need
            to remember to mount the virtual file systems if they are not
            already mounted. One way to do this is to create a script on the
            <span class="command"><strong>HOST</strong></span> system:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<span class="command"><strong>cat &gt; ~/mount-virt.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"
#!/bin/bash

function mountbind
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 &gt;/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount --bind /$1 $LFS/$1 
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

function mounttype
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 &gt;/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount -t $2 $3 $4 $5 $LFS/$1 
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

if [ $EUID -ne 0 ]; then
  SUDO=sudo
else
  SUDO=""
fi

if [ x$LFS == x ]; then
  echo "LFS not set"
  exit 1
fi

mountbind dev 
mounttype dev/pts devpts devpts -o gid=5,mode=620
mounttype proc    proc   proc
mounttype sys     sysfs  sysfs
mounttype run     tmpfs  run
mkdir $LFS/run/shm
#mountbind usr/src
#mountbind boot
#mountbind home
EOF</strong></span>
</pre>
          <p>
            Note that the last three commands in the script are commented
            out. These are useful if those directories are mounted as
            separate partitions on the host system and will be mounted when
            booting the completed LFS/BLFS system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The script can be run with <span class="command"><strong>bash
            ~/mount-virt.sh</strong></span> as either a regular user
            (recommended) or as root. If run as a regular user, sudo is
            required on the host system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue pointed out by the script is where to store
            downloaded package files. This location is arbitrary. It can be
            in a regular user's home directory such as ~/sources or in a
            global location like /usr/src. Our recommendation is not to mix
            BLFS sources and LFS sources in (from the chroot environment)
            /sources. In any case, the packages must be accessible inside the
            chroot environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A last convenience feature presented here is to streamline the
            process of entering the chroot environment. This can be done with
            an alias placed in a user's ~/.bashrc file on the host system:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<span class=
"command"><strong>alias lfs='sudo /usr/sbin/chroot /mnt/lfs /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1="\u:\w\\\\$ " 
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin /bin/bash --login'</strong></span>
</pre>
          <p>
            This alias is a little tricky because of the quoting and levels
            of backslash characters. It must be all on a single line. The
            above command has been split in two for presentation purposes.

            Work remotely via ssh
          </h3>
          <p>
            This method also provides a full graphical environment, but first
            requires installing <a class="xref" href=
            "openssh.html#sshd"><span class=
            "command"><strong>sshd</strong></span></a> and <a class="xref"
            href="wget.html" title="Wget-1.19.5">Wget-1.19.5</a> on the LFS
            system, usually in chroot. It also requires a second computer.
            This method has the advantage of being simple by not requiring
            the complexity of the chroot environment. It also uses your LFS
            built kernel for all additional packages and still provides a
            complete system for installing packages.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            Work from the LFS command line
          </h3>
          <p>
            This method requiures installing <a class="xref" href=
            "make-ca.html" title="make-ca-0.9">make-ca-0.9</a>, <a class=
            "xref" href="wget.html" title="Wget-1.19.5">Wget-1.19.5</a>,
            <a class="xref" href="gpm.html" title=
            "GPM-1.20.7">GPM-1.20.7</a>, and <a class="xref" href=
            "links.html" title="Links-2.17">Links-2.17</a> in chroot and then
            rebooting into the new LFS system. At this point the default
            system has six virtual consoles. Switching consoles is as easy as
            using the Alt-Fn key combinations where Fn is between F1 and F6.
            The Alt-LeftArrow and Alt-RightArrow key combinations also will
            change the console.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point you can log into two different virtual consoles and
            run the links browser in one console and bash in the other. GPM
            then allows copying commands from the browser with the left mouse
            button, switching consoles, and pasting into the other console.
          </p>

              Note
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a side note, switching of virtual consoles can also be done
              from an X Window instance with the Ctrl-Alt-Fn key combination,
              but the mouse copy operation does not work between the
              graphical interface and a virtual console. You can return to
              the X Window display with the Ctrl-Alt-Fn conbination where Fn
              is usually F7.

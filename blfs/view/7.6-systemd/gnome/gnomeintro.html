      <p>
        This chapter presents the instructions to install a complete
        GNOME-3.12 desktop environment. The order of the installed packages
        follows the build order defined by the GNOME development team and has
        been thoroughly tested by the BLFS team. You need to be building
        GNOME-3.12 on top of a system running <span class=
        "application">Systemd</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The installation of GNOME-3.12 is a large undertaking and one we
        would like to see you complete with the least amount of stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install GNOME as your desktop of choice, it is recommended that
        you install using <code class="option">--prefix=/usr</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your system was completely built per LFS and BLFS instructions,
        you have a very good chance of using GNOME-3.12 after your first
        installation. If you are a typical LFS user, you have made
        modifications to the instructions along the way knowing that you have
        to take those modifications into account on future installations. You
        should have no problems integrating GNOME-3.12 into your unique
        setup, but you will have to install well over 50 packages before you
        can run GNOME through any testing (assuming your windowing system is
        preinstalled and tested). You should anticipate that you will be
        rebuilding GNOME at least once to make adjustments for your setup.

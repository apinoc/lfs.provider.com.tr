      <p>
        Unlike the Linux From Scratch book, <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>
        isn't designed to be followed in a linear manner. This is because
        <span class="acronym">LFS</span> provides instructions on how to
        create a base system which is capable of turning into anything from a
        web server to a multimedia desktop system. <span class=
        "acronym">BLFS</span> is where we try to guide you in the process of
        going from the base system to your intended destination. Choice is
        very much involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone who reads the book will want to read certain sections. The
        <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> part&ndash;which you are
        currently reading&ndash;contains generic information. Especially take
        note of the information in Important Information (<a href=
        "important.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Important Information">Chapter&nbsp;2,
        Important Information</a>), as this contains comments about how to
        unpack software and various other aspects which apply throughout the
        book.
      </p>
      <p>
        The part on <a href="../postlfs/postlfs.html">Post LFS Configuration
        and Extra Software</a> is where most people will want to turn next.
        This deals with not just configuration but also Security (<a href=
        "../postlfs/security.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Security">Chapter&nbsp;4, Security</a>), File
        Systems (<a href="../postlfs/filesystems.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;File Systems">Chapter&nbsp;5, File
        Systems</a>), Editors (<a href="../postlfs/editors.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Editors">Chapter&nbsp;6, Editors</a>) and
        Shells (<a href="../postlfs/shells.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Shells">Chapter&nbsp;7, Shells</a>). Indeed,
        you may wish to reference certain parts of this chapter (especially
        the sections on Editors and File Systems) while building your
        <span class="acronym">LFS</span> system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following these basic items, most people will want to at least browse
        through the <a href="../general/general.html">General Libraries and
        Utilities</a> part of the book. This part contains information on
        many items which are prerequisites for other sections of the book as
        well as some items (such as Programming (<a href=
        "../general/prog.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Programming">Chapter&nbsp;12, Programming</a>)
        which are useful in their own right. Note that you don't have to
        install all of these libraries and packages found in this part to
        start with, each <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> install procedure
        tells you which packages it depends upon so you can choose the
        program you want to install and see what it needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, most people will probably want to look at the <a href=
        "../connect/connect.html">Connecting to a Network</a> and <a href=
        "../basicnet/basicnet.html">Basic Networking</a> parts. The first of
        these deals with connecting to the Internet or your <span class=
        "acronym">LAN</span> using a variety of methods such as <span class=
        "acronym">DHCP</span> (<a href="../connect/dhcp.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;14.&nbsp;DHCP Clients">Chapter&nbsp;14, <span class=
        "acronym">DHCP</span> Clients</a>) and Dial-Up Connections (<a href=
        "../connect/dialup.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;13.&nbsp;Dial-up networking">Chapter&nbsp;13, Dial-up
        networking</a>). The second of these parts deals with items such as
        Networking Libraries (<a href="../basicnet/netlibs.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Networking Libraries">Chapter&nbsp;16,
        Networking Libraries</a>) and various basic networking programs and
        utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have dealt with these basics, you may wish to configure more
        advanced network services. These are dealt with in the <a href=
        "../server/server.html">Server Networking</a> and <a href=
        "../content/content.html">Content Serving</a> parts of the book.
        Those wanting to build servers should find enough information to give
        them a good starting point here. Note that <a href=
        "../content/content.html">Content Serving</a> also contains
        information on various database packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next parts of the book principally deal with desktop systems. We
        start with a part talking about <a href="../x/x.html">X and Window
        Managers</a>. This part also deals with some generic X-based
        libraries (<a href="../x/lib.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;26.&nbsp;X Libraries">Chapter&nbsp;26, X
        Libraries</a>). After this, <a href="../kde/kde.html">KDE</a> and
        <a href="../gnome/gnome.html">GNOME</a> are given their own parts
        which are followed by one on <a href="../xsoft/xsoft.html">X
        Software</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then move on to deal with <a href=
        "../multimedia/multimedia.html">Multimedia</a> packages. Note that
        many people may want to use the <a href=
        "../multimedia/libdriv.html#alsa">ALSA-1.0.7</a> instructions from
        this chapter quite near the start of their <span class=
        "acronym">BLFS</span> journey; they are placed here simply because it
        is the most logical place for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final part of the main <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> book
        deals with <a href="../pst/pst.html">Printing, Scanning and
        Typesetting</a>. This is useful for most people with desktop systems
        and even those who are creating mainly server systems will find it
        useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy using <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> and find it
        useful.

        <p>
          Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I
          noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things
          beyond the base <span class="acronym">LFS</span> system. At the
          time, the only assistance specifically offered relating to
          <span class="acronym">LFS</span> were the <span class=
          "acronym">LFS</span> hints (<a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints"><span class=
          "url">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints</span></a>). Most of
          the <span class="acronym">LFS</span> hints are extremely good and
          well written but I (and others) could still see a need for more
          comprehensive help to go Beyond <span class="acronym">LFS</span> -
          hence <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> aims to be more than the
          <span class="acronym">LFS</span>-hints converted to <span class=
          "acronym">XML</span> although much of our work is based around the
          hints and indeed some authors write both hints and the relevant
          <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> sections. We hope that we can
          provide you with enough information to not only manage to build
          your system up to what you want, whether it be a web server or a
          multimedia desktop system, but also that you will learn a lot about
          system configuration as you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks as ever go to everyone in the <span class=
          "acronym">LFS</span>/<span class="acronym">BLFS</span> community;
          especially those who have contributed instructions, written text,
          answered questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask
          questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun
          on #lfs at irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details
          about all of these in the <a href=
          "../introduction/introduction.html">Introduction</a> section of the
          book.

        <p>
          Enjoy using <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>.

          I still remember how I found the <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>
          project and started using the instructions that were completed at
          the time. I could not believe how wonderful it was to get an
          application up and running very quickly, with explanations as to
          why things were done a certain way. Unfortunately, for me, it
          wasn't long before I was opening applications that had nothing more
          than "To be done" on the page. I did what most would do, I waited
          for someone else to do it. It wasn't too long before I am looking
          through <span class="application">Bugzilla</span> for something
          easy to do. As with any learning experience, the definition of what
          was easy kept changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We still encourage you to become involved as <span class=
          "acronym">BLFS</span> is never really finished. Contributing or
          just using, we hope you enjoy your <span class=
          "acronym">BLFS</span> experience.

          The <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> project is a natural
          progression of <span class="acronym">LFS</span>. Together, these
          projects provide a unique resource for the Open Source Community.
          They take the mystery out of the process of building a complete,
          funtional software system from the source code contibuted by many
          talented individuals throughout the world. They truly allow users
          to implement the slogan "Your distro, your rules."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to continue to provide the best resoure available that
          shows you how to integrate many significant Open Source
          applications. Since these applications are constantly updated and
          new applications are developed, this book will never be complete.
          Additionally, there is always room for improvement in explaining
          the nuances of how to install the different packages. To make these
          improvements, we need your feedback. I encourage you to participate
          on the different mailing lists, news groups, and <span class=
          "acronym">IRC</span> channels to help meet these goals.

          </div>
          <p>
            Version 6.0 is a major milestone in the evolution of BLFS. This
            version provides installation instructions for 357 packages and
            an additional 21 sections covering configuration and
            customization of different aspects of your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes and upgrades to the individual packages are detailed in
            the <a href="../introduction/changelog.html">Change Log</a>.
            There you will see literally hundreds of changes made since the
            last edition. In this change log, one name that you will see over
            and over is Randy McMurchy. Without his efforts this release
            would not have been possible. I want to take this opportunity to
            thank him for the hundreds of hours he has worked to produce this
            release. I also want to thank the other editors, both past and
            present, whose insight and effort have made this current version
            possible. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank our
            resident XSL wizard, Manuel Canales Esparcia, whose ability to
            format a complicated document such as BLFS is truly amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two other areas of change that are worthy of note.
            First, the license that BLFS is released under has changed
            significantly. In fact, it is now released under two licenses.
            The first license, the <a href=
            "../appendices/creat-comm.html">Creative Commons License</a>,
            covers the descriptive text in the book. The second, the <a href=
            "../appendices/ac-free-lic.html">Academic Free License v.
            2.1</a>, covers the instructions actually used to build and
            install the packages. These licenses, along with the book itself,
            represent our ongoing commitment to open and free sofware.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final area of change is the addition of an Index. This
            section of the book is still incomplete, but as the book
            continues to be developed, will become an excellent resource for
            finding programs, libraries, configuration files, and references
            to kernel configuration requirements. I hope you find it useful.

      <p>
        The intention of <span class="acronym">LFS</span> is to provide a
        basic system which you can build upon. There are several things,
        about tidying up the system, which many people wonder about once they
        have done the base install. We hope to cover these issues in this
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people coming from non-Unix like backgrounds to Linux find the
        concept of text-only configuration files slightly strange. In Linux,
        just about all configuration is done via text files. The majority of
        these files can be found in the <tt class="filename">/etc</tt>
        hierarchy. There are often graphical configuration programs available
        for different subsystems but most are simply pretty front ends to the
        process of editing the file. The advantage of text-only configuration
        is that you can edit parameters using your favorite text editor,
        whether that be <span><strong class="command">vim</strong></span>,
        <span><strong class="command">emacs</strong></span>, or anything
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first task is making a recovery diskette because it's the most
        critical need. Then the system is configured to ease addition of new
        users, in <a href="config.html#postlfs-config-bootdisk">Creating a
        Custom Boot Device</a>, because this can affect the choices you make
        in the two subsequent topics&mdash;<a href="profile.html">The Bash
        Shell Startup Files</a> and <a href="vimrc.html">The vimrc Files</a>.

        The remaining topics, <a href="logon.html">Customizing your Logon

              Decent Rescue Boot Device Needs
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            This section is really about creating a <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>rescue</em></span> device. As the name
            <span class="emphasis"><em>rescue</em></span> implies, the host
            system has a problem, often lost partition information or
            corrupted file systems, that prevent it from booting and/or
            operating normally. For this reason, you <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>must not</em></span> depend on resources from the
            host being "rescued". To presume that any given partition or hard
            drive <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be available is
            a risky presumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a modern system, there are many devices that can be used as a
            rescue device: floppy, cdrom, usb drive, or even a network card.
            Which one you use depends on your hardware and your BIOS. In the
            past, we usually thought of rescue device as a floppy disk.
            Today, many systems do not even have a floppy drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building a complete rescue device is a challenging task. In many
            ways, it is equivalent to building an entire <span class=
            "acronym">LFS</span> system. In addition, it would be a
            repitition of information already available. For these reasons,
            the procedures for a rescue device image are not presented here.

          <p>
            The software of today's systems has grown large. Linux 2.6 no
            longer supports booting directly from a floppy. In spite of this,
            there are solutions available using older version of Linux. One
            of the best is Tom's Root/Boot Disk available at <a href=
            "http://www.toms.net/rb/"><span class=
            "url">http://www.toms.net/rb/</span></a>. This will provide a
            minimal Linux system on a single floppy disk and provides the
            ability to customize the contents of your disk if necessary.

          </div>
          <p>
            There are several sources that can be used for a rescue CD-ROM.
            Just about any commercial distribution's installation CD-ROMs or
            DVDs will work. These include RedHat, Mandrake, and SuSE. One
            very popular option is Knoppix.

          <p>
            In addition, the LFS Community has developed its own Boot CD-ROM
            available at <a href=
            "ftp://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/isos/"><span class=
            "url">ftp://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/isos/</span></a>. A copy
            of this CD-ROM is available with the printed version of the Linux
            From Scratch book. If you download the ISO image, use <a href=
            "../multimedia/cdwriteutils.html#cdrecord"><span><strong class=
            "command">cdrecord</strong></span></a> to copy the image to a
            CD-ROM.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future, the build instructions for this CD-ROM will be
            presented, but they are not available at this writing.

          <p>
            A USB Pen drive, sometimes called a Thumb drive, is recognized by
            Linux as a SCSI device. Using one of these devices as a rescue
            device has the advantage that it is usually large enough to hold
            more than a minimal boot image. You can save critical data to the
            drive as well as use it to diagnose and recover a damaged system.
            Booting such a drive requires BIOS support, but building the
            system consists of formatting the drive, adding <span class=
            "application">grub</span> as well as the kernel and supporting
            files.

          Multimedia Libraries and Drivers

      <p>
        Many multimedia programs require libraries and/or drivers in order to
        function properly. The packages in this section fall into this
        category. Generally you only need to install these if you are
        installing a program which has the library listed as either a
        requirement, or as an option to enable it to support certain
        functionality.

        <p>
          The first question which people tend to ask about <span class=
          "acronym">ALSA</span> is why they should use it over the sound
          drivers included in the kernel&mdash;there are several reasons.
          First, the <span class="acronym">ALSA</span> drivers support more
          sound cards than those in the kernel. Second, the <span class=
          "acronym">OSS</span> emulation is in some cases faster and better
          than the original <span class="acronym">OSS</span> driver itself.
          And finally, there are some programs which can use <span class=
          "acronym">ALSA</span>'s enhanced features to better drive the sound
          card.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="acronym">ALSA</span> is also the future of Linux Sound
          (hence the name <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Linux Sound
          Architecture</em></span>). The <span class="acronym">ALSA</span>
          drivers were included into the main Linux kernel during the 2.5
          development series, and they are now the "standard" sound drivers
          in the 2.6 stable kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following six sections of the book deal with the six separate
          components of <span class="acronym">ALSA</span>: the drivers, the
          libraries, the utilities, the tools, the firmware and the
          <span class="acronym">OSS</span> compatibility libraries.

          Notes on downloading, unpacking and compiling software
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Those people who have built a <span class="acronym">LFS</span> system
        will be aware of the general principles of downloading and unpacking
        software. We will however repeat some of that information here for
        those new to building their own software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of installation instructions contains a <span class=
        "acronym">URL</span> from which you can download the package. We do
        however keep a selection of patches available via http. These are
        referenced as needed in the installation instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can keep the source <span class="acronym">TAR</span> balls
        anywhere you like, we assume that you have unpacked them and unzipped
        any required patches into <tt class="filename">/usr/src</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>clean source tree</em></span> each time.
        This means that if you have had an error, it's usually best to delete
        the source tree and re-unpack it <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>before</em></span> trying again. This obviously
        doesn't apply if you're an advanced user used to hacking Makefiles
        and C code, but if in doubt, start from a clean tree.
      </p>

            Unpacking the software
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          If a file is tar'ed and gzip'ed, it is unpacked by running one of
          the following two commands, depending on the filename:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class="command">tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz
tar -xvzf filename.tgz
tar -xvzf filename.tar.Z</b></span>
</pre>
        <p>
          If a file is tar'ed and bzip2'ed, it can usually be unpacked by
          running:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class="command">tar -jxvf filename.tar.bz2</b></span>
</pre>
        <p>
          You can also use a slightly different method:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class="command">bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv</b></span>
</pre>
        <p>
          Finally, you need to be able to unpack patches which are generally
          not tar'ed. The best way to do this is to copy the patch file to
          <tt class="filename">/usr/src</tt> and then to run one of the
          following commands depending on whether the file is .gz or .bz2:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class="command">gunzip patchname.gz
bunzip2 patchname.bz2</b></span>
</pre>

            Verifying file integrity using md5sum
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and
          complete, most package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the
          files. To verify the md5sum of the downloaded files, download both
          the file and the corresponding md5sum file to the same directory
          (preferably from different on-line locations), and (assuming
          file.md5sum is the md5sum file downloaded) run the following
          command:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class="command">md5sum -c file.md5sum</b></span>
</pre>
        <p>
          If there are any errors, they will be reported.

            Creating Log files during installation
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead
          of staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or
          warning. Log files are also useful for debugging and keeping
          records. The following command allows you to create an installation
          log. Replace &lt;command&gt; with the command you intend to
          execute.
        </p>
        <pre class="screen">
<span><b class=
"command">( &lt;command&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee compile.log &amp;&amp; exit $PIPESTATUS )</b></span>
</pre>
        <p>
          <i class="parameter"><tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt></i> redirects error
          messages to the same location as standard output. The
          <span><b class="command">tee</b></span> command allows viewing of
          the output while logging the results to a file. The parentheses
          around the command run the entire command in a subshell and finally
          the <span><b class="command">exit $PIPESTATUS</b></span> ensures
          the result of the &lt;command&gt; is returned as the result and not
          the result of the <span><b class="command">tee</b></span> command.

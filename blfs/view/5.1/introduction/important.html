        <p>
          Package Management is an often requested addition to the
          <span class="acronym">LFS</span> Book. A Package Manager allows
          tracking the installation of files making it easy to remove and
          upgrade packages. And before you begin to wonder, NO - this section
          does not talk about any particular package manager, nor does it
          recommend one. What it provides is a roundup of the more popular
          techniques and how they work. The perfect package manager for you
          may be among these techniques or may be a combination of two or
          more of these techniques. This section briefly mentions issues that
          may arise when upgrading packages.

              Upgrade Issues
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions as
            and when they are released. Generally the instructions in the
            <span class="acronym">LFS</span> and <span class=
            "acronym">BLFS</span> Book can be used to upgrade to the newer
            versions. Following are some points that you should be aware of
            when upgrading packages, especially on a running system.
          </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  It is recommended that if one of the toolchain package
                  (glibc, gcc, binutils) needs to be upgraded to a newer
                  minor vesion, it is safer to rebuild <span class=
                  "acronym">LFS</span>. Though you <span class=
                  "emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to get by rebuilding
                  all the packages in their dependency order. We do not
                  recommend the latter. For example, if glibc-2.2.x needs to
                  be updated to glibc-2.3.x, it is safer to rebuild. For
                  micro version updates, a simple reinstallation usually
                  works, but is not guaranteed. For example, upgrading from
                  glibc-2.3.1 to glibc-2.3.2 will not usually cause any
                  problems.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If a package containing a shared library is updated, and if
                  the soname of the library changes, then all the packages
                  dynamically linked to the library need to be recompiled to
                  link against the newer library. (Note that there is no
                  corelation between the package version and the soname of
                  the library.) For example, consider a package foo-1.2.3
                  that installs a shared library with soname <tt class=
                  "filename">libfoo.so.1</tt>. Say you upgrade the package to
                  a newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared library
                  with soname <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. In this
                  case, all packages that are dynamically linked to
                  <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.1</tt> need to be recompiled
                  to link against <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. Note
                  that you should not remove the previous libraries till the
                  dependent packages are recompiled.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you are upgrading a running system, be on the lookout
                  for packages that use <span><b class=
                  "command">cp</b></span> instead of <span><b class=
                  "command">install</b></span> to install files. The latter
                  command is usually safer if the executable or library is
                  already loaded in memory.

              Package Management Techniques
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The following are some common package management techniques.
            Before making a decision on a package manager, do a research on
            the various techniques, particularly the drawbacks of the
            particular scheme.

            <p>
              Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not
              find the need for a package manager because they know the
              packages intimately and know what files are installed by each
              package. Some users also do not need any package management
              because they plan on rebuilding the entire <span class=
              "acronym">LFS</span> when a package is changed.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a simplistic package management that does not need any
              extra package to manage the installations. Each package is
              installed in a separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1
              is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt> and
              a symlink is made from <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt>
              to <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt>. When installing
              a new version foo-1.2, it is installed in <tt class=
              "filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.2</tt> and the previous symlink is
              replaced by a symlink to the new vesion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The environment variables such as those mentioned in <a href=
              "beyond.html" title="Going Beyond BLFS">the section called
              &ldquo;Going Beyond BLFS&rdquo;</a> need to be expanded to
              include <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt>. For more than a
              few packages, this scheme becomes unmanageable.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
            <div class="titlepage">

                  </h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is a variation of the previous package management
              technique. Each package is installed similar to the previous
              scheme. But instead of making the symlink, each file is
              symlinked into <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> hierarchy. This
              removes the need to expand the environment variables. Though
              the symlinks can be created by the user, to automate the
              creation, many package managers have been written on this
              approach. A few of the popular ones are Stow, Epkg, Graft, and
              Depot.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation needs to be faked, so that the package thinks
              that it is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> though
              in reality it is installed in <tt class=
              "filename">/usr/pkg</tt> hierarchy. Installing in this manner
              is not usually a trivial task. For example, consider that you
              are installing a package libfoo-1.1. The following instructions
              may not install the package properly:
            </p>
            <pre class="screen">
<tt class="userinput"><span><b class=
"command">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</b></span></tt>
</pre>
            <p>
              The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not
              link to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package
              that links against libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
              <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt>
              instead of <tt class="filename">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt> as
              you would expect. The correct approach is to use <tt class=
              "envar">DESTDIR</tt> strategy to fake installation of the
              package. This approach works as follows:
            </p>
            <pre class="screen">
<tt class="userinput"><span><b class=
"command">./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</b></span></tt>
</pre>
            <p>
              Most of the packages do support this approach, but there are
              some which do not. For the non-compliant packages, you may
              either need to manually install the package, or you may find
              that it is easier to install some problematic packages into
              <tt class="filename">/opt</tt>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              In this technique, a file is timestamped before the
              installation of the package. After the installation, a simple
              use of the <span><b class="command">find</b></span> command
              with the appropriate options can generate a log of all the
              files installed after the timestamp file was created. A package
              manager written with this approach is install-log.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has
              two drawbacks. If during installation, the files are installed
              with any timestamp other than the current time, those files
              will not be tracked by the package manager. Also, this scheme
              can only be used when one package is installed at a time. The
              logs are not reliable if two packages are being installed on
              two different consoles.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              In this approach, a library is preloaded before installation.
              During installation, this library tracks the packages that are
              being installed by attaching itself to various executables such
              as <span><b class="command">cp</b></span>, <span><b class=
              "command">install</b></span>, <span><b class=
              "command">mv</b></span> and tracking the system calls that
              modify the filesystem. For this approach to work, all the
              executables need to be dymanically linked without the suid or
              sgid bit. Preloading the library may cause some unwanted
              side-effects during installation; hence do perform some tests
              to ensure that the package manager does not break anything and
              logs all the appropriate files.

            <p>
              In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a
              separate tree as described in the Symlink style package
              management. After the installation, a package archive is
              created using the installed files. This archive is then used to
              install the package either on the local machine or can even be
              used to install the package on other machines.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is used by most of the package managers found in
              the commercial distributions. Examples of package Managers that
              follow this approach are RPM, pkg-utils, Debian's apt, Gentoo's
              Portage system.

              This scheme, that is unique to <span class=
              "acronym">LFS</span>, was devised by Matthias Benkmann, and is
              available from the <a href=
              "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/">Hints Project</a>. In
              this scheme, each package is installed as a separate user into
              the standard locations. Files belonging to a package are easily
              identified by checking the user id. The features and
              shortcomings of this approach are too complex to describe in
              this section. For the details please see the hint at <a href=

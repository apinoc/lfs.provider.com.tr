        If you encounter a problem while using this book, and your problem is
        not listed in the <span class="acronym">FAQ</span> (<a href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq</a>),
        you will find that most of the people on Internet Relay Chat
        (<span class="acronym">IRC</span>) and on the mailing lists are
        willing to help you. An overview of the <span class=
        "acronym">LFS</span> mailing lists can be found in <a href=
        "maillists.html">Mailing lists</a>. To assist us in diagnosing and
        solving your problem, include as much relevant information as
        possible in your request for help.

            Things to check prior to asking
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before asking for help, you should review the following items:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Is the hardware support compiled into the kernel or available
                as a module to the kernel? If it is a module, is it
                configured properly in <tt class="filename">modules.conf</tt>
                and has it been loaded? You should use <span><b class=
                "command">lsmod</b></span> as root to see if it's loaded.
                Check the <tt class="filename">sys.log</tt> or run
                <span><b class="command">modprobe &lt;driver&gt;</b></span>
                to review any error message. If it loads properly, you may
                need to add the <span><b class="command">modprobe</b></span>
                to your boot scripts.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Are your permissions properly set, especially for devices?
                <span class="acronym">LFS</span> uses groups to make these
                settings easier, but it also adds the step of adding users to
                groups to allow access. A simple <span><b class=
                "command">moduser -G audio &lt;user&gt;</b></span> may be all
                that's necessary for that user to have access to the sound
                system. Any question that starts out with "It works as root,
                but not as ..." requires a thorough review of permissions
                prior to asking.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> liberally uses <tt class=
                "filename">/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt>. The main objection to
                this centers around the need to expand your environment
                variables for each package placed there (e.g.,
                PATH=$PATH:/opt/kde/bin). In some cases, the package will
                walk you through the changes, but some will not. The section
                called "<a href="beyond.html">Going Beyond BLFS</a>" is
                available to help you check.

        </div>
        <p>
          Apart from a brief explanation of the problem you're having, the
          essential things to include in your request are:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                the version of the book you are using (being 5.1),
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the package or section giving you problems,
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the exact error message or symptom you are receiving,
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                whether you have deviated from the book or <span class=
                "acronym">LFS</span> at all.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          (Note that saying that you've deviated from the book doesn't mean
          that we won't help you. It'll just help us to see other possible
          causes of your problem.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Expect guidance instead of specific instructions. If you are
          instructed to read something, please do so, it generally implies
          that the answer was way too obvious and that the question would not
          have been asked if a little research was done prior to asking. The
          volunteers in the mailing list prefer not to be used as an
          alternative to doing reasonable research on your end. In addition,
          the quality of your experience with <span class=
          "acronym">BLFS</span> is also greatly enhanced by this research,
          and the quality of volunteers is enhanced because they don't feel
          that their time has been abused, so they are far more likely to
          participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          An excellent article on asking for help on the Internet in general
          has been written by Eric S. Raymond. It is available online at
          <a href=
          "http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a>.
          Read and follow the hints in that document and you are much more
          likely to get a response to start with and also to get the help you
          actually need.

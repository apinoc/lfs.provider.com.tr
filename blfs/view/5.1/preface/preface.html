        <p>
          Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I
          noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things
          beyond the base <span class="acronym">LFS</span> system. At the
          time, the only assistance specifically offered relating to
          <span class="acronym">LFS</span> were the <span class=
          "acronym">LFS</span> hints (<a href=
          "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints</a>).
          Most of the <span class="acronym">LFS</span> hints are extremely
          good and well written but I (and others) could still see a need for
          more comprehensive help to go Beyond <span class=
          "acronym">LFS</span> - hence <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> aims to be more than the
          <span class="acronym">LFS</span>-hints converted to <span class=
          "acronym">XML</span> although much of our work is based around the
          hints and indeed some authors write both hints and the relevant
          <span class="acronym">BLFS</span> sections. We hope that we can
          provide you with enough information to not only manage to build
          your system up to what you want, whether it be a web server or a
          multimedia desktop system, but also that you will learn a lot about
          system configuration as you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks as ever go to everyone in the <span class=
          "acronym">LFS</span>/<span class="acronym">BLFS</span> community;
          especially those who have contributed instructions, written text,
          answered questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask
          questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun
          on #lfs at irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details
          about all of these in the <a href=
          "../introduction/introduction.html">Introduction</a> section of the
          book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy using <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>.

          I still remember how I found the <span class="acronym">BLFS</span>
          project and started using the instructions that were completed at
          the time. I could not believe how wonderful it was to get an
          application up and running very quickly, with explanations as to
          why things were done a certain way. Unfortunately, for me, it
          wasn't long before I was opening applications that had nothing more
          than "To be done" on the page. I did what most would do, I waited
          for someone else to do it. It wasn't too long before I am looking
          through <span class="application">Bugzilla</span> for something
          easy to do. As with any learning experience, the definition of what
          was easy kept changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We still encourage you to become involved as <span class=
          "acronym">BLFS</span> is never really finished. Contributing or
          just using, we hope you enjoy your <span class=
          "acronym">BLFS</span> experience.

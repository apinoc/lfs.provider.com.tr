            Introduction to Firewall Creation
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The general purpose of a firewall is to protect a network against
          malicious access by using a single machine as a firewall. This does
          imply that the firewall is to be considered a single point of
          failure, but it can make the administrator's life a lot easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a perfect world where you knew that every daemon or service on
          every machine was perfectly configured and was immune to, e.g.,
          buffer-overflows and any other imaginable problem regarding its
          security, and where you trusted every user accessing your services
          to aim no harm, you wouldn't need to have a firewall! In the real
          world however, daemons may be misconfigured, exploits against
          essential services are freely available, you may wish to choose
          which services are accessible by certain machines, you may wish to
          limit which machines or applications are allowed to have Internet
          access, or you may simply not trust some of your apps or users. In
          these situations you might benefit by using a firewall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't assume however, that having a firewall makes careful
          configuration redundant, or that it makes any negligent
          misconfiguration harmless. It also doesn't prevent anyone from
          exploiting a service you intentionally offer but haven't recently
          updated or patched after an exploit went public. Despite having a
          firewall, you need to keep applications and daemons on your system
          well-configured and up-to-date; a firewall is not a cure-all!

            This is a setup or program, for Windows commercially sold by
            companies such as Symantec, of which they claim or pretend that
            it secures a home or desktop-pc with Internet access. This topic
            is highly relevant for users who do not know the methods their
            computers might be accessed via the Internet or how to disable
            them, especially if they are always online and connected via
            broadband links.

            This is a box placed between the Internet and an intranet. To
            minimize the risk of compromising the firewall itself it should
            generally have only one role, that of protecting the intranet.
            Although not completely risk free, the tasks of doing the routing
            and eventually IP masquerading (rewriting IP-headers of the
            packets it routes from clients with private IP-addresses onto the
            Internet so that they seem to come from the firewall itself) are
            commonly considered harmless.

            This is often an old box you may have retired and nearly
            forgotten, performing masquerading or routing functions, but
            offering a bunch of services, e.g., web-cache, mail, etc. This
            may be very commonly used for home networks, but can definitely
            not be considered as secure anymore because the combining of
            server and router on one machine raises the complexity of the
            setup.

            IP's and a physically separated structure, is neither considered
            to be part of the inter- nor intranet. These servers are those
            which must be easily accessible from both the inter- and
            intranet. The firewall protects them all.

            configuration of a firewall at the time of the Linux 2.2 kernel.
            It's still possible to configure a firewall this way, but it
            makes the rules quite complex and lengthy.

          This document is meant as an introduction to how to setup a
          firewall. It is not a complete guide to securing systems.
          Firewalling is a complex issue that requires careful configuration.
          The scripts quoted here are simply intended to give examples as to
          how a firewall works, they are not intended to fit into any
          imaginable configuration and may not prevent any imaginable attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this text is simply to give you a hint on how to get
          started with a firewall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customization of these scripts for your specific situation will be
          necessary for an optimal configuration, but you should make a
          serious study of the iptables documentation and creating firewalls
          in general before hacking away. Have a look at the list of <a href=
          "firewall.html#postlfs-security-fw-library">Links for further
          reading</a> at the end of this section for more details. Here you
          will find a list of URLs that contain quite comprehensive
          information about building your own firewall.

            Getting a firewall enabled Kernel

        <p>
          If you want your Linux-Box to have a firewall, you must first
          ensure that your kernel has been compiled with the relevant options
          turned on.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to configure your kernel, with enabling the options to be
          either compiled into the kernel or as modules, depends on your
          personal preferences and experience. Note, that for the quoted
          scripts it is assumed that the modules need to be loaded at first.

            With this script your intranet should be sufficiently secure
            against external attacks. No one should be able to setup a new
            connection to any internal service and, if it's masqueraded, it's
            even invisible. Furthermore, your firewall should be nearly
            immune because there are no services running that a cracker could
            attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: if the interface you're connecting to the Internet doesn't
            connect via ppp, you will need to change <i class=
            "replaceable"><tt>ppp+</tt></i> to the name of the interface
            which you are using. If you are using the same interface type to
            connect to both your intranet and the Internet, you need to use
            the actual name of the interface such as <span class=
            "strong">eth0</span>, on both interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need stronger security (e.g., against DOS, connection
            highjacking, spoofing, etc.), have a look at the list of <a href=

            This scenario isn't too different from (<a href=
            "firewall.html#postlfs-security-fw-masqRouter">Masquerading
            Router</a>), but in this case you want to offer some services to
            your intranet. Examples of this can be when you want to admin
            your box from another host on your intranet or use it as a proxy
            or a name server. Note: Outlining a true concept of how to
            protect a server that offers services on the Internet goes far
            beyond the scope of this document, see <a href=
            "firewall.html#postlfs-security-fw-disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be cautious. Every service you offer and have enabled makes your
            setup more complex and your box less secure. You induce the risks
            of misconfigured services or running a service with an
            exploitable bug. A firewall should generally not run any extra
            services. See the introduction to <a href=
            "firewall.html#postlfs-security-fw-masqRouter">Masquerading
            Router</a> for some more details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the services you'd like to offer do not need to access the
            Internet themselves, like internal-only samba- or name-servers,
            it's quite simple and should still be acceptable from a security
            standpoint. Just add the following lines <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the logging-rules into the
            script.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
iptables -A INPUT  -i ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT
</pre>
          <p>
            If your daemons have to access the web themselves, like squid
            would need to, you could open OUTPUT generally and restrict
            INPUT.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED   -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT                                      -j ACCEPT
</pre>
          <p>
            However, it is generally not advisable to leave OUTPUT
            unrestricted. You lose any control over trojans who'd like to
            "call home", and a bit of redundancy in case you've
            (mis-)configured a service so that it does broadcast its
            existence to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you prefer to have this protection, you may restrict INPUT and
            OUTPUT on all ports except those that it's absolutely necessary
            to have open. Which ports you have to open depends on your needs:
            mostly you will find them by looking for failed accesses in your
            log-files.

                  certain delays because some implementations of these
                  daemons have the feature of querying an identd on your box
                  for logging usernames. Although there's really no harm in
                  this, having an identd running is not recommended because
                  some implementations are known to be vulnerable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To avoid these delays you could reject the requests with a

                  To log and drop invalid packets (harmless packets that came

                  Anything coming from the outside should not have a private
                  address, this is a common attack called IP-spoofing:

                  To simplify debugging and be fair to anyone who'd like to
                  access a service you have disabled, purposely or by
                  mistake, you should REJECT those packets that are dropped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Obviously this must be done directly after logging as the
                  very last lines before the packets are dropped by policy:

            These are only examples to show you some of the capabilities of
            the new firewall code in Linux-Kernel 2.4. Have a look at the man
            page of iptables. There you will find more of them. The
            port-numbers you'll need for this can be found in <tt class=
            "filename">/etc/services</tt>, in case you didn't find them by
            trial and error in your log file.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you add any of your offered or accessed services such as the
            above, maybe even in FORWARD and for intranet-communication, and
            delete the general clauses, you get an old fashioned packet
            filter.

          Finally, I'd like to remind you of one fact we must not forget: The
          effort spent attacking a system corresponds to the value the
          cracker expects to gain from it. If you are responsible for such
          valuable assets that you expect great effort to be made by
          potential crackers, you hopefully won't be in the need of this
          hint!

      <p>
        When you first boot up your new <span class="acronym">LFS</span>
        system, the logon screen will be nice and plain (as it should be in a
        bare-bones system). Many people however, will want their system to
        display some information in the logon message. This can be
        accomplished using the file <tt class="filename">/etc/issue</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt class="filename">/etc/issue</tt> file is a plain text file
        which will also accept certain Escape sequences (see below) in order
        to insert information about the system. There is also the file
        <tt class="filename">issue.net</tt> which can be used when logging on
        remotely. <span><b class="command">ssh</b></span> however, will only
        use it if you set the option in the configuration file and will also
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> interpret the escape
        sequences shown below.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most common things which people want to do is to clear the
        screen at each logon. The easiest way of doing that is to put a
        "clear" escape-sequence into <tt class="filename">/etc/issue</tt>. A
        simple way of doing this is to do <tt class=
        "userinput"><span><b class="command">clear &gt;
        /etc/issue</b></span></tt>. This will insert the relevant escape code
        into the start of the <tt class="filename">/etc/issue</tt> file. Note
        that if you do this, when you edit the file, you should leave the ^[c
        character on the first line alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following escapes are recognized by agetty (the program which
        usually parses <tt class="filename">/etc/issue</tt>). This
        information is from <span><b class="command">man agetty</b></span>
        where you can find extra information about the logon process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt class="filename">issue</tt> file can contain certain escape
        codes to display various information. All escape codes consist of a
        backslash (\) immediately followed by one of the letters explained
        below (so <tt class="option">\d</tt> in <tt class=
        "filename">/etc/issue</tt> would insert the current date).
      </p>
      <pre class="screen">
b   Insert the baudrate of the current line.
d   Insert the current date.
s   Insert the system name, the name of the operating system.
l   Insert the name of the current tty line.
m   Insert the architecture identifier of the machine, e.g., i486
n   Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the hostname.
o   Insert the domainname of the machine.
r   Insert the release number of the kernel, e.g., 2.4.16.
t   Insert the current time.
u   Insert the number of current users logged in.
U   Insert the string "1 user" or "&lt;n&gt; users" where &lt;n&gt; is the
    number of current users logged in.
v   Insert the version of the <span class=
"acronym">OS</span>, e.g., the build-date etc.

      </h1>
      <p>
        On some recent PCs it can be necessary, or desirable, to load
        firmware to make them work at their best. There is a directory,
        <code class="filename">/lib/firmware</code>, where the kernel or
        kernel drivers look for firmware images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparing firmware for multiple different machines, as a distro would
        do, is outside the scope of this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, most firmware can be found at a <strong class=
        "userinput"><code>git</code></strong> repository: <a class="ulink"
        href=
        "http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/">
        http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/</a>.
        For convenience, the LFS Project has created a mirror, updated daily,
        where these firmware files can be accessed via <strong class=
        "userinput"><code>wget</code></strong> or a web browser at <a class=
        "ulink" href=
        "http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/">http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/linux-firmware/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get the firmware, either point a browser to one of the above
        repositories and then download the item(s) which you need, or install
        <strong class="userinput"><code>git</code></strong> and clone that
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some other firmware, particularly for Intel microcode and certain
        wifi devices, the needed firmware is not available in the above
        repository. Some of this will be addressed below, but a search of the
        Internet for needed firmware is sometimes necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firmware files are conventionally referred to as blobs because you
        cannot determine what they will do. Note that firmware is distributed
        under various different licenses which do not permit disassembly or
        reverse-engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firmware for PCs falls into four categories:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="compact">
          <li>
            <p>
              Updates to the CPU to work around errata, usually referred to
              as microcode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Firmware for video controllers. On x86 machines this seems to
              only apply to ATI devices : Radeons require firmware to be able
              to use KMS (kernel modesetting - the preferred option) as well
              as for Xorg. For earlier radeon chips (before the R600), the
              firmware is still in the kernel.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Firmware updates for wired network ports. Mostly they work even
              without the updates, but one must assume that they will work
              better with the updated firmware.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Firmware for other devices, such as wifi. These devices are not
              required for the PC to boot, but need the firmware before these
              devices can be used.

          Although not needed to load a firmware blob, the following tools

          <a id="cpu-microcode" name="cpu-microcode"></a>Microcode updates
          for CPUs
        </h2>
        <p>
          In general, microcode can be loaded by the BIOS or UEFI, and it
          might be updated by upgrading to a newer version of those. On
          linux, you can also load the microcode from the kernel if you are
          using an AMD family 10h or later processor (first introduced late
          2007), or an Intel processor from 1998 and later (Pentium4, Core,
          etc), if updated microcode has been released. These updates only
          last until the machine is powered off, so they need to be applied
          on every boot.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways of loading the microcode, described as 'early'
          and 'late'. Early loading happens before userspace has been
          started, late loading happens when userspace has started. Not
          surprisingly, early loading is preferred, (see e.g. an explanatory
          comment in a kernel commit noted at <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://lwn.net/Articles/530346/">x86/microcode: Early load
          microcode</a> on LWN.) Indeed, it is needed to work around one
          particular erratum in early Intel Haswell processors which had TSX
          enabled. (See <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.anandtech.com/show/8376/intel-disables-tsx-instructions-erratum-found-in-haswell-haswelleep-broadwellyi/">
          Intel Disables TSX Instructions: Erratum Found in Haswell,
          Haswell-E/EP, Broadwell-Y</a>.) Without this update glibc can do
          the wrong thing in uncommon situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is much simpler to begin by building a kernel which boots on
          your hardware, try late microcode loading to see if there is an
          update (in many cases the BIOS or UEFI will have already applied
          any update), and then take the extra steps required for early
          loading.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means you will be reconfiguring your kernel if you use early
          loading, so keep the built source around to minimise what gets
          rebuilt, and if you are at all uncertain, add your own identifier
          (A,B, etc) to the end of the EXTRAVERSION in the kernel
          configuration, e.g. "EXTRAVERSION -A" if nothing was set.
        </p>
        <p>
          To confirm what processor(s) you have (if more than one, they will
          be identical) look in /proc/cpuinfo.

          </h3>
          <h4>
            Required Package
          </h4>
          <p class="required">
            <a class="ulink" href=
            "http://fedorahosted.org/released/microcode_ctl/">http://fedorahosted.org/released/microcode_ctl/</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            For Intel CPUs an extra package, microcode_ctl, is required. The
            package chosen is the version hosted at fedora &mdash; there is
            an alternative version at github from the same packager, but that
            still includes a redundant old version of an AMD microcode
            container, and also requires the unzip package.
          </p>
          <p>
            Download the latest version from the link above; when last
            checked this was 2.1-8 and is updated when Intel releases new
            microcode.
          </p>
          <p>
            This package reformats the microcode supplied by Intel into a
            format which the kernel can apply. The program <strong class=
            "userinput"><code>intel-microcode2ucode</code></strong> is built
            and invoked by the Makefile to create the individual firmware
            blobs, so there is no reason to install it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Begin by extracting the tarball and changing to the directory it
            created. Then change to the source directory and run:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            This creates various blobs with names in the form XX-YY-ZZ. Now
            you need to determine your processor's identity, to see if there
            is any microcode for it. Determine the decimal values of the cpu
            family, model and stepping by running:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">head -n7 /proc/cpuinfo</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            Now convert the cpu family, model and stepping to pairs of
            hexadecimal digits. For a SandyBridge i3-2120 (described as
            Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2120 CPU) the relevant values are cpu family
            6, model 42, stepping 7 so in this case the required
            identification is 06-2a-07. A look at the blobs will show that
            there is one for this CPU (although it might have already been
            applied by the BIOS). If there is a blob for your system then
            test if it will be applied by copying it (replace
            &lt;XX-YY-ZZ&gt; by the identifier for your machine) to where the
            kernel can find it:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/intel-ucode
cp -v &lt;XX-YY-ZZ&gt; /lib/firmware/intel-ucode</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            Now that the Intel microcode has been prepared, use the following
            options when you configure the kernel to try late loading of the
            Intel microcode:

            The family is always specified in hex. Families 10h to 14h (16 to
            20) are in microcode_amd.bin. Families 15h and 16h have their own
            containers. Create the required directory and put the firmware

          <p>
            It does not matter where you prepare the initrd, and once it is
            working you can apply the same initrd to later LFS systems or
            newer kernels on this same machine, at least until any newer
            microcode is released. Use the following commands:

</pre>
          <p>

            You will now need to reconfigure and rebuild your kernel. It is
            safer to either add/change the EXTRAVERSION in the kernel's
            configuration and install the newer kernel with a new name, or
            else (unless you have a machine which requires an early firmware
            update) wait for the next SUBLEVEL kernel release so that you can
            fall back to the existing kernel in the event that something goes
            wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also need to add a new entry to /boot/grub/grub.cfg and
            here you should add a new line after the linux line within the
            stanza. If /boot is a separate mountpoint:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">initrd /microcode.img</kbd>

          <p>
            or this if it is not:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">initrd /boot/microcode.img</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            You must also change the kernel config:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">

</pre>
          <p>
            Retain the setting for INTEL or AMD microcode. When you have
            saved the .config file, either CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL_EARLY=y or
            CONFIG_MICROCODE_AMD_EARLY=y should be set, together with
            CONFIG_MICROCODE_EARLY=y.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have installed and booted this kernel, you should check
            the output of dmesg to confirm that the early load worked. The
            places and times where this happens are very different in AMD and
            Intel machines. First, an Intel example where a development
            kernel is being tested, showing that the first notification comes
            before the kernel version is mentioned:

          <p>
            These instructions do NOT apply to old radeons before the R600
            family. For those, the firmware is in the kernel's <code class=
            "filename">/lib/firmware/</code> directory. Nor do they apply if
            you intend to avoid a graphical setup such as Xorg and are
            content to use the default 80x25 display rather than a
            framebuffer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early radeon devices only needed a single 2K blob of firmware.
            Recent devices need several different blobs, and some of them are
            much bigger. The total size of the radeon firmware directory is
            over 500K &mdash; on a large modern system you can probably spare
            the space, but it is still redundant to install all the unused
            files each time you build a system.
          </p>
          <p>
            A better approach is to install <a class="xref" href=
            "../general/pciutils.html" title=
            "pciutils-3.5.2">pciutils-3.5.2</a> and then use <strong class=
            "userinput"><code>lspci</code></strong> to identify which VGA
            controller is installed.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that information, check the RadeonFeature page of the Xorg
            wiki for <a class="ulink" href=
            "http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/#index5h2">Decoder ring for
            engineering vs marketing names</a> to identify the family (you
            may need to know this for the Xorg driver in BLFS &mdash;
            Southern Islands and Sea Islands use the radeonsi driver) and the
            specific model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you know which controller you are using, consult the
            <a class="ulink" href=
            "https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Radeon#Firmware">Radeon</a> page of
            the Gentoo wiki which has a table listing the required firmware
            blobs for the various chipsets. Note that Southern Islands and
            Sea Islands chips use different firmware for kernel 3.17 and
            later compared to earlier kernels. Identify and download the
            required blobs then install them:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/radeon
cp -v &lt;YOUR_BLOBS&gt; /lib/firmware/radeon</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>
            There are actually two ways of installing this firmware. BLFS, in
            the 'Kernel Configuration for additional firmware' section part
            of the <a class="xref" href="../x/x7driver.html#xorg-ati-driver"
            title="Xorg ATI Driver-7.8.0">Xorg ATI Driver-7.8.0</a> section
            gives an example of compiling the firmware into the kernel - that
            is slightly faster to load, but uses more kernel memory. Here we
            will use the alternative method of making the radeon driver a
            module. In your kernel config set the following:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">Device Drivers ---&gt;
  Graphics support ---&gt;
      Direct Rendering Manager ---&gt;

      &lt;m&gt; ATI Radeon                                        [CONFIG_DRM_RADEON]</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            Loading several large blobs from /lib/firmware takes a noticeable
            time, during which the screen will be blank. If you do not enable
            the penguin framebuffer logo, or change the console size by using
            a bigger font, that probably does not matter. If desired, you can
            slightly reduce the time if you follow the alternate method of
            specifying 'y' for CONFIG_DRM_RADEON covered in BLFS at the link
            above &mdash; you must specify each needed radeon blob if you do
            that.

        <p>
          The kernel likes to load firmware for some network drivers,
          particularly those from Realtek (the /lib/linux-firmware/rtl_nic/)
          directory, but they generally appear to work without it. Therefore,
          you can boot the kernel, check dmesg for messages about this
          missing firmware, and if necessary download the firmware and put it
          in the specified directory in /lib/firmware so that it will be
          found on subsequent boots. Note that with current kernels this
          works whether or not the driver is compiled in or built as a
          module, there is no need to build this firmware into the kernel.
          Here is an example where the R8169 driver has been compiled in but
          the firmware was not made available. Once the firmware had been
          provided, there was no mention of it on later boots.
        </p>

          Identifying the correct firmware will typically require you to
          install <a class="xref" href="../general/pciutils.html" title=
          "pciutils-3.5.2">pciutils-3.5.2</a>, and then use <strong class=
          "userinput"><code>lspci</code></strong> to identify the device. You
          should then search online to check which module it uses, which
          firmware, and where to obtain the firmware &mdash; not all of it is
          in linux-firmware.
        </p>
        <p>
          If possible, you should begin by using a wired connection when you
          first boot your LFS system. To use a wireless connection you will
          need to use a network tools such as <a class="xref" href=
          "../basicnet/wireless_tools.html" title=
          "Wireless Tools-29">Wireless Tools-29</a> and <a class="xref" href=

        </p>
        <p>
          Firmware may also be needed for other devices such as some SCSI
          controllers, bluetooth adaptors, or TV recorders. The same
          principles apply.

        This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based on
        the LFS book. It will also be useful for those who are using other
        distributions, but for one reason or another want to manually build
        software and are in need of some assistance. Note that the material
        contained in this book, in particular the dependency listings, is
        based upon the assumption that you are using a base LFS system with
        every package listed in the LFS book already installed and
        configured. BLFS can be used to create a range of diverse systems and
        so the target audience is probably nearly as wide as that of the LFS
        book. If you found LFS useful, you should also like this!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Release 5.0, the BLFS book version matches the LFS book
        version. This book may be incompatible with a previous or latter
        release of the LFS book.

            Notes on Building Software
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Those people who have built an LFS system may be aware of the
          general principles of downloading and unpacking software. We will
          however repeat some of that information here for those new to
          building their own software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each set of installation instructions contains a URL from which you
          can download the package. We do however keep a selection of patches
          available via HTTP. These are referenced as needed in the
          installation instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you can keep the source files anywhere you like, we assume
          that you have unpacked the package and changed into the directory
          created by the unpacking process (the 'build' directory). We also
          assume you have uncompressed any required patches and they are in
          the directory immediately above the 'build' directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>clean source tree</em></span> each time.
          This means that if you have had an error during configuration or
          compilation, it's usually best to delete the source tree and
          re-unpack it <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> trying
          again. This obviously doesn't apply if you're an advanced user used
          to hacking <tt class="filename">Makefile</tt>s and C code, but if
          in doubt, start from a clean tree.

          </div>
          <p>
            The golden rule of Unix System Administration is to use your
            superpowers only when necessary. Hence, BLFS recommends that you
            build software as an unprivileged user and only become the
            <tt class="systemitem">root</tt> user when installing the
            software. This philosophy is followed in all the packages in this
            book. Unless otherwise specified, all instructions should be
            executed as an unprivileged user. The book will advise you on
            instructions that need <tt class="systemitem">root</tt>
            privileges.

          <p>
            If a file is in <tt class="filename">.tar</tt> format and
            compressed, it is unpacked by running one of the following
            commands:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=

                You may omit using the <tt class="option">v</tt> parameter in
                the commands shown above and below if you wish to suppress
                the verbose listing of all the files in the archive as they
                are extracted. This can help speed up the extraction as well
                as make any errors produced during the extraction more
                obvious to you.

            You can also use a slightly different method:

          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Finally, you sometimes need to be able to unpack patches which
            are generally not in <tt class="filename">.tar</tt> format. The
            best way to do this is to copy the patch file to parent of the
            'build' directory and then run one of the following commands
            depending on whether the file is a <tt class="filename">.gz</tt>
            or <tt class="filename">.bz2</tt> file:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">gunzip -v patchname.gz
bunzip2 -v patchname.bz2</kbd></pre>

              Verifying File Integrity Using 'md5sum'
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and
            complete, many package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the
            files. To verify the md5sum of the downloaded files, download
            both the file and the corresponding md5sum file to the same
            directory (preferably from different on-line locations), and
            (assuming <tt class="filename">file.md5sum</tt> is the md5sum
            file downloaded) run the following command:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">md5sum -c file.md5sum</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            If there are any errors, they will be reported. Note that the
            BLFS book includes md5sums for all the source files also. To use
            the BLFS supplied md5sums, you can create a <tt class=
            "filename">file.md5sum</tt> (place the md5sum data and the exact
            name of the downloaded file on the same line of a file, separated
            by white space) and run the command shown above. Alternately,
            simply run the command shown below and compare the output to the
            md5sum data shown in the BLFS book.

              Creating Log Files During Installation
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead
            of staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or
            warning. Log files are also useful for debugging and keeping
            records. The following command allows you to create an
            installation log. Replace <em class=
            "replaceable"><tt>&lt;command&gt;</tt></em> with the command you
            intend to execute.
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">( <em class=
          "replaceable"><tt>&lt;command&gt;</tt></em> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee compile.log &amp;&amp; exit $PIPESTATUS )</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            <tt class="option">2&gt;&amp;1</tt> redirects error messages to
            the same location as standard output. The <span><strong class=
            "command">tee</strong></span> command allows viewing of the
            output while logging the results to a file. The parentheses
            around the command run the entire command in a subshell and
            finally the <span><strong class="command">exit
            $PIPESTATUS</strong></span> command ensures the result of the
            <em class="replaceable"><tt>&lt;command&gt;</tt></em> is returned
            as the result and not the result of the <span><strong class=

          <p>
            There are times when automating the building of a package can
            come in handy. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting to
            automate building, and everyone goes about it in their own way.
            Creating <tt class="filename">Makefile</tt>s, <span class=
            "application">Bash</span> scripts, <span class=
            "application">Perl</span> scripts or simply a list of commands
            used to cut and paste are just some of the methods you can use to
            automate building BLFS packages. Detailing how and providing
            examples of the many ways you can automate the building of
            packages is beyond the scope of this section. This section will
            expose you to using file redirection and the <span><strong class=
            "command">yes</strong></span> command to help provide ideas on
            how to automate your builds.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a id="id2702437" name="id2702437"></a>File Redirection to
            Automate Input
          </h3>
          <p>
            You will find times throughout your BLFS journey when you will
            come across a package that has a command prompting you for
            information. This information might be configuration details, a
            directory path, or a response to a license agreement. This can
            present a challenge to automate the building of that package.
            Occasionally, you will be prompted for different information in a
            series of questions. One method to automate this type of scenario
            requires putting the desired responses in a file and using
            redirection so that the program uses the data in the file as the
            answers to the questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building the <span class="application">CUPS</span> package is a
            good example of how redirecting a file as input to prompts can
            help you automate the build. If you run the test suite, you are
            asked to respond to a series of questions regarding the type of
            test to run and if you have any auxiliary programs the test can
            use. You can create a file with your responses, one response per
            line, and use a command similar to the one shown below to
            automate running the test suite:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">make check &lt; ../cups-1.1.23-testsuite_parms</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            This effectively makes the test suite use the responses in the
            file as the input to the questions. Occasionally you may end up
            doing a bit of trial and error determining the exact format of
            your input file for some things, but once figured out and
            documented you can use this to automate building the package.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a id="id2633681" name="id2633681"></a>Using <span><strong class=
            "command">yes</strong></span> to Automate Input
          </h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes you will only need to provide one response, or provide
            the same response to many prompts. For these instances, the
            <span><strong class="command">yes</strong></span> command works
            really well. The <span><strong class=
            "command">yes</strong></span> command can be used to provide a
            response (the same one) to one or more instances of questions. It
            can be used to simulate pressing just the <span><strong class=
            "keycap">Enter</strong></span> key, entering the
            <span><strong class="keycap">Y</strong></span> key or entering a
            string of text. Perhaps the easiest way to show its use is in an
            example.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, create a short <span class="application">Bash</span>
            script by entering the following commands:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">cat &gt; blfs-yes-test1 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal">#!/bin/bash

echo -n -e "\n\nPlease type something (or nothing) and press Enter ---&gt; "

read A_STRING

if test "$A_STRING" = ""; then A_STRING="Just the Enter key was pressed"
else A_STRING="You entered '$A_STRING'"
fi

echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"</tt>
EOF
chmod 755 blfs-yes-test1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Now run the script by issuing <span><strong class=
            "command">./blfs-yes-test1</strong></span> from the command line.
            It will wait for a response, which can be anything (or nothing)
            followed by the <span><strong class=
            "keycap">Enter</strong></span> key. After entering something, the
            result will be echoed to the screen. Now use the
            <span><strong class="command">yes</strong></span> command to
            automate the entering of a response:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">yes | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Notice that piping <span><strong class=
            "command">yes</strong></span> by itself to the script results in
            <span><strong class="keycap">y</strong></span> being passed to
            the script. Now try it with a string of text:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">yes 'This is some text' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            The exact string was used as the response to the script. Finally,
            try it using an empty (null) string:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">yes '' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Notice this results in passing just the press of the
            <span><strong class="keycap">Enter</strong></span> key to the
            script. This is useful for times when the default answer to the
            prompt is sufficient. This syntax is used in the <a href=
            "../basicnet/net-tools.html#net-tools-automate-example">Net-tools</a>
            instructions to accept all the defaults to the many prompts
            during the configuration step. You may now remove the test
            script, if desired.
          </p>

            <a id="id2698108" name="id2698108"></a>File Redirection to
            Automate Output
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to automate the building of some packages, especially
            those that require you to read a license agreement one page at a
            time, requires using a method that avoids having to press a key
            to display each page. Redirecting the output to a file can be
            used in these instances to assist with the automation. The
            previous section on this page touched on creating log files of
            the build output. The redirection method shown there used the
            <span><strong class="command">tee</strong></span> command to
            redirect output to a file while also displaying the output to the
            screen. Here, the output will only be sent to a file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, the easiest way to demonstrate the technique is to show an
            example. First, issue the command:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">ls -l /usr/bin | more</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Of course, you'll be required to view the output one page at a
            time because the <span><strong class=
            "command">more</strong></span> filter was used. Now try the same
            command, but this time redirect the output to a file. The special
            file <tt class="filename">/dev/null</tt> can be used instead of
            the filename shown, but you will have no log file to examine:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">ls -l /usr/bin | more &gt; redirect_test.log 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Notice that this time the command immediately returned to the
            shell prompt without having to page through the output. You may
            now remove the log file.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last example will use the <span><strong class=
            "command">yes</strong></span> command in combination with output
            redirection to bypass having to page through the output and then
            provide a <span><strong class="keycap">y</strong></span> to a
            prompt. This technique could be used in instances when otherwise
            you would have to page through the output of a file (such as a
            license agreement) and then answer the question of
            &ldquo;<span class="quote">do you accept the
            above?</span>&rdquo;. For this example, another short
            <span class="application">Bash</span> script is required:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">cat &gt; blfs-yes-test2 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal">#!/bin/bash

ls -l /usr/bin | more

echo -n -e "\n\nDid you enjoy reading this? (y,n) "

read A_STRING

if test "$A_STRING" = "y"; then A_STRING="You entered the 'y' key"
else A_STRING="You did NOT enter the 'y' key"
fi

echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"</tt>
EOF
chmod 755 blfs-yes-test2</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            This script can be used to simulate a program that requires you
            to read a license agreement, then respond appropriately to accept
            the agreement before the program will install anything. First,
            run the script without any automation techniques by issuing
            <span><strong class="command">./blfs-yes-test2</strong></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now issue the following command which uses two automation
            techniques, making it suitable for use in an automated build
            script:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">yes | ./blfs-yes-test2 &gt; blfs-yes-test2.log 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            If desired, issue <span><strong class="command">tail
            blfs-yes-test2.log</strong></span> to see the end of the paged
            output, and confirmation that <span><strong class=
            "keycap">y</strong></span> was passed through to the script. Once
            satisfied that it works as it should, you may remove the script
            and log file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, keep in mind that there are many ways to automate and/or
            script the build commands. There is not a single
            &ldquo;<span class="quote">correct</span>&rdquo; way to do it.
            Your imagination is the only limit.

          <p>
            For each package described, BLFS lists the known dependencies.
            These are listed under several headings, whose meaning is as
            follows:
          </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>Required</em></span> means that
                  the target package cannot be correctly built without the
                  dependency having first been installed.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommended</em></span> means
                  that BLFS strongly suggests this package is installed first
                  for a clean and trouble-free build, that won't have issues
                  either during the build process, or at run-time.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>Optional</em></span> means that
                  this package might be installed for added functionality.
                  Often BLFS will describe the dependency to explain the
                  added functionality that will result.

            Introduction to Firewall Creation
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The general purpose of a firewall is to protect a computer or a
          network against malicious access.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a perfect world, every daemon or service on every machine is
          perfectly configured and immune to flaws such as buffer overflows
          or other problems regarding its security. Furthermore, you trust
          every user accessing your services. In this world, you do not need
          to have a firewall.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the real world however, daemons may be misconfigured and
          exploits against essential services are freely available. You may
          wish to choose which services are accessible by certain machines or
          you may wish to limit which machines or applications are allowed
          external access. Alternatively, you may simply not trust some of
          your applications or users. You are probably connected to the
          Internet. In this world, a firewall is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't assume however, that having a firewall makes careful
          configuration redundant, or that it makes any negligent
          misconfiguration harmless. It doesn't prevent anyone from
          exploiting a service you intentionally offer but haven't recently
          updated or patched after an exploit went public. Despite having a
          firewall, you need to keep applications and daemons on your system
          properly configured and up to date. A firewall is not a cure all,
          but should be an essential part of your overall security strategy.

          The word firewall can have several different meanings.

            This is a hardware device or software program commercially sold
            (or offered via freeware) by companies such as Symantec which
            claims that it secures a home or desktop computer connected to
            the Internet. This type of firewall is highly relevant for users
            who do not know how their computers might be accessed via the
            Internet or how to disable that access, especially if they are
            always online and connected via broadband links.

            This is a system placed between the Internet and an intranet. To
            minimize the risk of compromising the firewall itself, it should
            generally have only one role&mdash;that of protecting the
            intranet. Although not completely risk free, the tasks of doing
            the routing and IP masquerading (rewriting IP headers of the
            packets it routes from clients with private IP addresses onto the
            Internet so that they seem to come from the firewall itself) are
            commonly considered relatively secure.

            This is often an old computer you may have retired and nearly
            forgotten, performing masquerading or routing functions, but
            offering non-firewall services such as a web-cache or mail. This
            may be used for home networks, but is not to be considered as
            secure as a firewall only machine because the combination of
            server and router/firewall on one machine raises the complexity
            of the setup.

            This box performs masquerading or routing, but grants public
            access to some branch of your network which, because of public
            IPs and a physically separated structure, is essentially a
            separate network with direct Internet access. The servers on this
            network are those which must be easily accessible from both the
            Internet and intranet. The firewall protects both networks. This
            type of firewall has a minimum of three network interfaces.

            fast, but quite limited in its ability to block undesired packets
            without blocking desired packets.

              This introduction on how to setup a firewall is not a complete
              guide to securing systems. Firewalling is a complex issue that
              requires careful configuration. The scripts quoted here are
              simply intended to give examples of how a firewall works. They
              are not intended to fit into any particular configuration and
              may not provide complete protection from an attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customization of these scripts for your specific situation will
              be necessary for an optimal configuration, but you should make
              a serious study of the iptables documentation and creating
              firewalls in general before hacking away. Have a look at the
              list of <a href="firewall.html#fw-library">links for further
              reading</a> at the end of this section for more details. There
              you will find a list of URLs that contain quite comprehensive
              information about building your own firewall.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The firewall configuration script installed in the iptables section
          differs from the standard configuration script. It only has two of
          the standard targets: start and status. The other targets are clear
          and lock. For instance if you issue:
        </p>
        <pre class="root"><kbd class=
        "command">/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables start</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          the firewall will be restarted just as it is upon system startup.
          The status target will present a list of all currently implemented
          rules. The clear target turns off all firewall rules and the lock
          target will block all packets in and out of the computer with the
          exception of the loopback interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main startup firewall is located in the file <tt class=
          "filename">/etc/rc.d/rc.iptables</tt>. The sections below provide
          three different approaches that can be used for a system.

              You should always run your firewall rules from a script. This
              ensures consistency and a record of what was done. It also
              allows retention of comments that are essential for
              understanding the rules long after they were written.

            This script is quite simple, it drops all traffic coming into

            A true Firewall has two interfaces, one connected to an intranet,
            in this example <span class=

            Internet, here <span class="strong"><strong>ppp0</strong></span>.
            To provide the maximum security for the firewall itself, make
            sure that there are no unnecessary servers running on it such as
            <span class="application">X11</span> et al. As a general
            principle, the firewall itself should not access any untrusted
            service (think of a remote server giving answers that makes a
            daemon on your system crash, or even worse, that implements a
            worm via a buffer-overflow).

            With this script your intranet should be reasonably secure
            against external attacks. No one should be able to setup a new
            connection to any internal service and, if it's masqueraded,
            makes your intranet invisible to the Internet. Furthermore, your
            firewall should be relatively safe because there are no services
            running that a cracker could attack.

                Outlining a true concept of how to protect a server that
                offers services on the Internet goes far beyond the scope of
                this document. See the references at the end of this section

            Be cautious. Every service you have enabled makes your setup more
            complex and your firewall less secure. You are exposed to the
            risks of misconfigured services or running a service with an
            exploitable bug. A firewall should generally not run any extra
            services. See the introduction to the <a href=
            "firewall.html#fw-masqRouter">Masquerading Router</a> for some
            more details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to add services such as internal Samba or name
            servers that do not need to access the Internet themselves, the
            additional statements are quite simple and should still be
            acceptable from a security standpoint. Just add the following
            lines into the script <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the logging rules.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><tt class=
          "literal">iptables -A INPUT  -i ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o ! ppp+  -j ACCEPT</tt></pre>
          <p>
            If daemons, such as squid, have to access the Internet
            themselves, you could open OUTPUT generally and restrict INPUT.
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><tt class=
          "literal">iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT</tt></pre>
          <p>
            However, it is generally not advisable to leave OUTPUT
            unrestricted. You lose any control over trojans who would like to
            "call home", and a bit of redundancy in case you've
            (mis-)configured a service so that it broadcasts its existence to
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accomplish this, you should restrict INPUT and OUTPUT on all
            ports except those that it's absolutely necessary to have open.
            Which ports you have to open depends on your needs: mostly you
            will find them by looking for failed accesses in your log files.

                  system to obtain usernames. Although there's really little
                  harm in this, having an identd running is not recommended
                  because many security experts feel the service gives out
                  too much additional information.

                <p>

                  mistake, you could REJECT those packets that are dropped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Obviously this must be done directly after logging as the

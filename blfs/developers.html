     <h1>Getting Involved with BLFS</h1>
     
     <p>A common question on the mailing lists is: "How do I get involved?".
     Therefore, we wrote this page to try and answer that question.</p>
    
     <p>The first thing which we suggest you do is to subscribe to the <a
     href="/mail.html">blfs-book and blfs-dev mailing lists</a>. blfs-dev
     contains discussion about the book's development while blfs-book receives
     information on all commits and ticket traffic associated with BLFS.</p>

     <p>You need to install Git on your computer to really be able to
     help out with BLFS. Naturally, the best way to do this is by following the
     instructions in the BLFS book itself! You can then check out the XML
     source to the book using the following command:</p>

     <div class="cmd">
       <p>git clone git://git.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs.git blfs-git</p>
     </div>

     <p>The procedure above will get the current trunk of the repository. 
        When you wish to update your tree, simply issue:</p>

     <div class="cmd">
       <p>git pull</p>
     </div>

     <p>while in the blfs-git directory.</p>

     <p>Information on converting the book from XML into HTML format can be
     found in the INSTALL and README files. You will need to install libxslt,
     DocBook XSL Stylesheets, HTML Tidy (optional for html), Lynx
     (for text) and FOP (for PDF) for this to work. Full information is in the
     INSTALL file.</p>

     <p>Once you have familiarized yourself with the book layout, have a look
     at our <a href="https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">Ticket
     System</a>. If you want to be able to create tickets, ask for
     access on the <a href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/blfs-dev/">
     blfs-dev</a> mailing list.</p>

     <p>Finally, have fun and get involved with discussions on the lists. Try
     emailing blfs-dev (for book issues) or blfs-support (for build issues) when
     you have problems as the BLFS team reads those lists regularly. Once you
     have something which you wish to submit, create a diff file (preferably
     using diff -Naur) and submit it to the blfs-dev list where one of the
     editors will pick it up. For more details about how to update the BLFS
     book, take a look at the <a
     href="https://rivendell.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/LFS-EDITORS-GUIDE.html">
     LFS Editor's Guide</a>.</p>

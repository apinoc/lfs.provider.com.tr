     <h1>What is Beyond Linux From Scratch?</h1>
     <p>Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS) is a project that continues
     where the LFS book finishes. It assists users in developing their
     systems according to their needs by providing a broad range of
     instructions for installing and configuring various packages on top
     of a base LFS system.</p>

     <h2>Why would I want a BLFS system?</h2>
     <p>If you are wondering why you would want a BLFS system or don't know what
     LFS is, then you don't want to be here just yet &mdash; you should head
     over to the <a href="../lfs/index.html">LFS Project Homepage</a> where all
     will be explained.</p>

     <h2>What can I do with my BLFS system?</h2>
     <p>Nearly anything! An LFS system is primed to become a system that fits
     whatever need you have. BLFS is the book that takes you down your own custom
     path. You could build an office workstation, a multimedia desktop, a router, a
     server, or all of the above! And the best part is you only install what you
     need.</p>

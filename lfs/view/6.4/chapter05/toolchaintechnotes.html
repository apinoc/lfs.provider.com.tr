      <p>
        This section explains some of the rationale and technical details
        behind the overall build method. It is not essential to immediately
        understand everything in this section. Most of this information will
        be clearer after performing an actual build. This section can be
        referred back to at any time during the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall goal of <a class="xref" href="chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        is to provide a temporary environment that can be chrooted into and
        from which can be produced a clean, trouble-free build of the target
        LFS system in <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html"
        title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter
        6</a>. Along the way, we separate the new system from the host system
        as much as possible, and in doing so, build a self-contained and
        self-hosted toolchain. It should be noted that the build process has
        been designed to minimize the risks for new readers and provide
        maximum educational value at the same time.

          Before continuing, be aware of the name of the working platform,
          often referred to as the target triplet. Many times, the target
          triplet will probably be <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>i686-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>. A simple way to
          determine the name of the target triplet is to run the <span class=
          "command"><strong>config.guess</strong></span> script that comes
          with the source for many packages. Unpack the Binutils sources and
          run the script: <strong class=
          "userinput"><code>./config.guess</code></strong> and note the
          output.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also be aware of the name of the platform's dynamic linker, often
          referred to as the dynamic loader (not to be confused with the
          standard linker <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>
          that is part of Binutils). The dynamic linker provided by Glibc
          finds and loads the shared libraries needed by a program, prepares
          the program to run, and then runs it. The name of the dynamic
          linker will usually be <code class="filename">ld-linux.so.2</code>.
          On platforms that are less prevalent, the name might be
          <code class="filename">ld.so.1</code>, and newer 64 bit platforms
          might be named something else entirely. The name of the platform's
          dynamic linker can be determined by looking in the <code class=
          "filename">/lib</code> directory on the host system. A sure-fire
          way to determine the name is to inspect a random binary from the
          host system by running: <strong class="userinput"><code>readelf -l
          &lt;name of binary&gt; | grep interpreter</code></strong> and
          noting the output. The authoritative reference covering all
          platforms is in the <code class="filename">shlib-versions</code>
          file in the root of the Glibc source tree.

        Some key technical points of how the <a class="xref" href=
        "chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        build method works:

            <p>
              The process is similar in principle to cross-compiling, whereby
              tools installed in the same prefix work in cooperation, and
              thus utilize a little GNU &ldquo;<span class=
              "quote">magic</span>&rdquo;

              Careful manipulation of <span class=
              "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>'s <code class=

              dynamic linker will be used

        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Binutils is installed first because the <span class=
        "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> runs of both GCC and
        Glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker to
        determine which software features to enable or disable. This is more
        important than one might first realize. An incorrectly configured GCC
        or Glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain, where the impact of
        such breakage might not show up until near the end of the build of an
        entire distribution. A test suite failure will usually highlight this
        error before too much additional work is performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
        <code class="filename">/tools/bin</code> and <code class=
        "filename">/tools/$TARGET_TRIPLET/bin</code>. The tools in one
        location are hard linked to the other. An important facet of the
        linker is its library search order. Detailed information can be
        obtained from <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> by
        passing it the <em class="parameter"><code>--verbose</code></em>
        flag. For example, an <strong class="userinput"><code>ld --verbose |
        grep SEARCH</code></strong> will illustrate the current search paths
        and their order. It shows which files are linked by <span class=
        "command"><strong>ld</strong></span> by compiling a dummy program and
        passing the <em class="parameter"><code>--verbose</code></em> switch
        to the linker. For example, <strong class="userinput"><code>gcc
        dummy.c -Wl,--verbose 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep succeeded</code></strong>
        will show all the files successfully opened during the linking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next package installed is GCC. An example of what can be seen
        during its run of <span class=
        "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> is:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><code class=
      "computeroutput">checking what assembler to use...
        /tools/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/as
checking what linker to use... /tools/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld</code></pre>
      <p>
        This is important for the reasons mentioned above. It also
        demonstrates that GCC's configure script does not search the PATH
        directories to find which tools to use. However, during the actual
        operation of <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>
        itself, the same search paths are not necessarily used. To find out
        which standard linker <span class=
        "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> will use, run: <strong class=
        "userinput"><code>gcc -print-prog-name=ld</code></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed information can be obtained from <span class=
        "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> by passing it the <em class=
        "parameter"><code>-v</code></em> command line option while compiling
        a dummy program. For example, <strong class="userinput"><code>gcc -v
        dummy.c</code></strong> will show detailed information about the
        preprocessor, compilation, and assembly stages, including
        <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>'s included search
        paths and their order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next package installed is Glibc. The most important
        considerations for building Glibc are the compiler, binary tools, and
        kernel headers. The compiler is generally not an issue since Glibc
        will always use the <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>
        found in a <code class="envar">PATH</code> directory. The binary
        tools and kernel headers can be a bit more complicated. Therefore,
        take no risks and use the available configure switches to enforce the
        correct selections. After the run of <span class=
        "command"><strong>configure</strong></span>, check the contents of
        the <code class="filename">config.make</code> file in the
        <code class="filename">glibc-build</code> directory for all important
        details. Note the use of <em class="parameter"><code>CC="gcc
        -B/tools/bin/"</code></em> to control which binary tools are used and
        the use of the <em class="parameter"><code>-nostdinc</code></em> and
        <em class="parameter"><code>-isystem</code></em> flags to control the
        compiler's include search path. These items highlight an important
        aspect of the Glibc package&mdash;it is very self-sufficient in terms
        of its build machinery and generally does not rely on toolchain
        defaults.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Glibc installation, make some adjustments to ensure that
        searching and linking take place only within the <code class=
        "filename">/tools</code> prefix. Install an adjusted <span class=
        "command"><strong>ld</strong></span>, which has a hard-wired search
        path limited to <code class="filename">/tools/lib</code>. Then amend
        <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>'s specs file to
        point to the new dynamic linker in <code class=
        "filename">/tools/lib</code>. This last step is vital to the whole
        process. As mentioned above, a hard-wired path to a dynamic linker is
        embedded into every Executable and Link Format (ELF)-shared
        executable. This can be inspected by running: <strong class=
        "userinput"><code>readelf -l &lt;name of binary&gt; | grep
        interpreter</code></strong>. Amending gcc's specs file ensures that
        every program compiled from here through the end of this chapter will
        use the new dynamic linker in <code class=
        "filename">/tools/lib</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second pass of GCC, its sources also need to be modified to
        tell GCC to use the new dynamic linker. Failure to do so will result
        in the GCC programs themselves having the name of the dynamic linker
        from the host system's <code class="filename">/lib</code> directory
        embedded into them, which would defeat the goal of getting away from
        the host.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the second pass of Binutils, we are able to utilize the
        <em class="parameter"><code>--with-lib-path</code></em> configure
        switch to control <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>'s
        library search path. From this point onwards, the core toolchain is
        self-contained and self-hosted. The remainder of the <a class="xref"
        href="chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        packages all build against the new Glibc in <code class=
        "filename">/tools</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon entering the chroot environment in <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter
        6</a>, the first major package to be installed is Glibc, due to its
        self-sufficient nature mentioned above. Once this Glibc is installed
        into <code class="filename">/usr</code>, perform a quick changeover
        of the toolchain defaults, then proceed in building the rest of the
        target LFS system.

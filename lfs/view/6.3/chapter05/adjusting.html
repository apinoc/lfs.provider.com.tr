        Adjusting the Toolchain
      </h1>
      <p>
        Now that the temporary C libraries have been installed, all tools
        compiled in the rest of this chapter should be linked against these
        libraries. In order to accomplish this, the linker and the compiler's
        specs file need to be adjusted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linker, adjusted at the end of the first pass of Binutils, needs
        to be renamed so that it can be properly found and used. First,
        backup the original linker, then replace it with the adjusted linker.
        We'll also create a link to its counterpart in <code class=
        "filename">/tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">mv -v /tools/bin/{ld,ld-old}
mv -v /tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin/{ld,ld-old}
mv -v /tools/bin/{ld-new,ld}
ln -sv /tools/bin/ld /tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin/ld</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        From this point onwards, everything will link only against the
        libraries in <code class="filename">/tools/lib</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next task is to point GCC to the new dynamic linker. This is done
        by dumping GCC's &ldquo;<span class="quote">specs</span>&rdquo; file
        to a location where GCC will look for it by default. A simple
        <span class="command"><strong>sed</strong></span> substitution then
        alters the dynamic linker that GCC will use.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of accuracy, it is recommended to use a copy-and-paste
        method when issuing the following command. Be sure to visually
        inspect the specs file and verify that all occurrences of
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo; have been
        replaced with &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">/tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;:
      </p>
      <div class="admon important">
        <img alt="[Important]" src="../images/important.png" />
        <h3>
          Important
        </h3>
        <p>
          If working on a platform where the name of the dynamic linker is
          something other than <code class="filename">ld-linux.so.2</code>,
          replace &ldquo;<span class="quote">ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo; with
          the name of the platform's dynamic linker in the following
          commands. Refer to <a class="xref" href="toolchaintechnotes.html"
          title="5.2.&nbsp;Toolchain Technical Notes">Section&nbsp;5.2,
          &ldquo;Toolchain Technical Notes,&rdquo;</a> if necessary.
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">gcc -dumpspecs | sed 's@^/lib/ld-linux.so.2@/tools&amp;@g' \
  &gt; `dirname $(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)`/specs</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        During the build process, GCC runs a script (<span class=
        "command"><strong>fixincludes</strong></span>) that scans the system
        for header files that may need to be fixed (they might contain syntax
        errors, for example), and installs the fixed versions in a private
        include directory. There is a possibility that, as a result of this
        process, some header files from the host system have found their way
        into GCC's private include directory. As the rest of this chapter
        only requires the headers from GCC and Glibc, which have both been
        installed at this point, any &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">fixed</span>&rdquo; headers can safely be removed. This helps
        to avoid any host headers polluting the build environment. Run the
        following commands to remove the header files in GCC's private
        include directory (you may find it easier to copy and paste these
        commands, rather than typing them by hand, due to their length):
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">GCC_INCLUDEDIR=`dirname $(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)`/include &amp;&amp;
find ${GCC_INCLUDEDIR}/* -maxdepth 0 -xtype d -exec rm -rvf '{}' \; &amp;&amp;
rm -vf `grep -l "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" ${GCC_INCLUDEDIR}/*` &amp;&amp;
unset GCC_INCLUDEDIR</kbd></pre>
      <div class="admon caution">
        <img alt="[Caution]" src="../images/caution.png" />
        <h3>
          Caution
        </h3>
        <p>
          At this point, it is imperative to stop and ensure that the basic
          functions (compiling and linking) of the new toolchain are working
          as expected. To perform a sanity check, run the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">echo 'main(){}' &gt; dummy.c
cc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /tools'</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          If everything is working correctly, there should be no errors, and
          the output of the last command will be of the form:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><code class=
        "computeroutput">[Requesting program interpreter:
    /tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2]</code></pre>
        <p>
          Note that <code class="filename">/tools/lib</code> appears as the
          prefix of the dynamic linker.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the output is not shown as above or there was no output at all,
          then something is wrong. Investigate and retrace the steps to find
          out where the problem is and correct it. This issue must be
          resolved before continuing on. First, perform the sanity check
          again, using <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>
          instead of <span class="command"><strong>cc</strong></span>. If
          this works, then the <code class="filename">/tools/bin/cc</code>
          symlink is missing. Revisit <a class="xref" href="gcc-pass1.html"
          title="5.4.&nbsp;GCC-4.1.2 - Pass 1">Section&nbsp;5.4,
          &ldquo;GCC-4.1.2 - Pass 1,&rdquo;</a> and install the symlink.
          Next, ensure that the <code class="envar">PATH</code> is correct.
          This can be checked by running <span class="command"><strong>echo
          $PATH</strong></span> and verifying that <code class=
          "filename">/tools/bin</code> is at the head of the list. If the
          <code class="envar">PATH</code> is wrong it could mean that you are
          not logged in as user <code class="systemitem">lfs</code> or that
          something went wrong back in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter04/settingenvironment.html" title=
          "4.4.&nbsp;Setting Up the Environment">Section&nbsp;4.4,
          &ldquo;Setting Up the Environment.&rdquo;</a> Another option is
          that something may have gone wrong with the specs file amendment
          above. In this case, redo the specs file amendment, being careful
          to copy-and-paste the commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all is well, clean up the test files:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">rm -v dummy.c a.out</kbd></pre>
      </div>
      <div class="admon note">
        <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />

        <p>
          Building TCL in the next section will serve as an additional check
          that the toolchain has been built properly. If TCL fails to build,
          it is an indication that something has gone wrong with the
          Binutils, GCC, or Glibc installation, but not with TCL itself.

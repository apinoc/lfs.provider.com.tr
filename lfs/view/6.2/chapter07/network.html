        This section only applies if a network card is to be configured.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a network card will not be used, there is likely no need to create
        any configuration files relating to network cards. If that is the
        case, remove the <tt class="filename">network</tt> symlinks from all
        run-level directories (<tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/rc*.d</tt>).

            7.13.1. Creating stable names for network interfaces
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Instructions in this section are optional if you have only one
          network card.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Udev and modular network drivers, the network interface
          numbering is not persistent across reboots by default, because the
          drivers are loaded in parallel and, thus, in random order. For
          example, on a computer having two network cards made by Intel and
          Realtek, the network card manufactured by Intel may become
          <tt class="filename">eth0</tt> and the Realtek card becomes
          <tt class="filename">eth1</tt>. In some cases, after a reboot the
          cards get renumbered the other way around. To avoid this, create
          Udev rules that assign stable names to network cards based on their
          MAC addresses or bus positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are going to use MAC addresses to identify your network
          cards, find the addresses with the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">grep -H . /sys/class/net/*/address</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          For each network card (but not for the loopback interface), invent
          a descriptive name, such as &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">realtek</span>&rdquo;, and create Udev rules similar to the
          following:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">cat &gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/26-network.rules &lt;&lt; EOF
<tt class=
"literal">ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", SYSFS{address}=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>00:e0:4c:12:34:56</tt></em>", \
    NAME="<em class="replaceable"><tt>realtek</tt></em>"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", SYSFS{address}=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>00:a0:c9:78:9a:bc</tt></em>", \
    NAME="<em class="replaceable"><tt>intel</tt></em>"</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
        <div class="note">
          <div class="admonhead">

          <div class="admonbody">
            <p>
              Although the examples in this book work properly, be aware that
              <span class="application">udev</span> does not recognize the
              backslash for line continuation. If modifying <span class=
              "application">udev</span> rules with an editor, be sure to
              leave each rule on one physical line.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you are going to use the bus position as a key, create Udev
          rules similar to the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">cat &gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/26-network.rules &lt;&lt; EOF
<tt class="literal">ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", BUS=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>pci</tt></em>", ID=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>0000:00:0c.0</tt></em>", \
    NAME="<em class="replaceable"><tt>realtek</tt></em>"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", BUS=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>pci</tt></em>", ID=="<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>0000:00:0d.0</tt></em>", \
    NAME="<em class="replaceable"><tt>intel</tt></em>"</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          These rules will always rename the network cards to
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">realtek</span>&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">intel</span>&rdquo;, independently of
          the original numbering provided by the kernel (i.e.: the original
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">eth0</span>&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">eth1</span>&rdquo; interfaces will no
          longer exist, unless you put such &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">descriptive</span>&rdquo; names in the NAME key). Use the
          descriptive names from the Udev rules instead of
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">eth0</span>&rdquo; in the network
          interface configuration files below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the rules above don't work for every setup. For example,
          MAC-based rules break when bridges or VLANs are used, because
          bridges and VLANs have the same MAC address as the network card.
          One wants to rename only the network card interface, not the bridge
          or VLAN interface, but the example rule matches both. If you use
          such virtual interfaces, you have two potential solutions. One is
          to add the DRIVER=="?*" key after SUBSYSTEM=="net" in MAC-based
          rules which will stop matching the virtual interfaces. This is
          known to fail with some older Ethernet cards because they don't
          have the DRIVER variable in the uevent and thus the rule does not
          match with such cards. Another solution is to switch to rules that
          use the bus position as a key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second known non-working case is with wireless cards using the
          MadWifi or HostAP drivers, because they create at least two
          interfaces with the same MAC address and bus position. For example,
          the Madwifi driver creates both an athX and a wifiX interface where
          X is a digit. To differentiate these interfaces, add an appropriate
          KERNEL parameter such as KERNEL=="ath*" after SUBSYSTEM=="net".
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be other cases where the rules above don't work.
          Currently, bugs on this topic are still being reported to Linux
          distributions, and no solution that covers every case is available.

            7.13.2. Creating Network Interface Configuration Files
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Which interfaces are brought up and down by the network script
          depends on the files and directories in the <tt class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/network-devices</tt> hierarchy. This
          directory should contain a sub-directory for each interface to be
          configured, such as <tt class="filename">ifconfig.xyz</tt>, where
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">xyz</span>&rdquo; is a network interface
          name. Inside this directory would be files defining the attributes
          to this interface, such as its IP address(es), subnet masks, and so
          forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following command creates a sample <tt class=
          "filename">ipv4</tt> file for the <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>eth0</em></span> device:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">cd /etc/sysconfig/network-devices &amp;&amp;
mkdir -v ifconfig.eth0 &amp;&amp;
cat &gt; ifconfig.eth0/ipv4 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal">ONBOOT=yes
SERVICE=ipv4-static
IP=192.168.1.1
GATEWAY=192.168.1.2
PREFIX=24
BROADCAST=192.168.1.255</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          The values of these variables must be changed in every file to
          match the proper setup. If the <tt class="envar">ONBOOT</tt>
          variable is set to &ldquo;<span class="quote">yes</span>&rdquo; the
          network script will bring up the Network Interface Card (NIC)
          during booting of the system. If set to anything but
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">yes</span>&rdquo; the NIC will be
          ignored by the network script and not be brought up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt class="envar">SERVICE</tt> variable defines the method used
          for obtaining the IP address. The LFS-Bootscripts package has a
          modular IP assignment format, and creating additional files in the
          <tt class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/network-devices/services</tt>
          directory allows other IP assignment methods. This is commonly used
          for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which is addressed
          in the BLFS book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt class="envar">GATEWAY</tt> variable should contain the
          default gateway IP address, if one is present. If not, then comment
          out the variable entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt class="envar">PREFIX</tt> variable needs to contain the
          number of bits used in the subnet. Each octet in an IP address is 8
          bits. If the subnet's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then it is using
          the first three octets (24 bits) to specify the network number. If
          the netmask is 255.255.255.240, it would be using the first 28
          bits. Prefixes longer than 24 bits are commonly used by DSL and
          cable-based Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In this example
          (PREFIX=24), the netmask is 255.255.255.0. Adjust the <tt class=
          "envar">PREFIX</tt> variable according to your specific subnet.

        <p>
          If the system is going to be connected to the Internet, it will
          need some means of Domain Name Service (DNS) name resolution to
          resolve Internet domain names to IP addresses, and vice versa. This
          is best achieved by placing the IP address of the DNS server,
          available from the ISP or network administrator, into <tt class=
          "filename">/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. Create the file by running the
          following:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">cat &gt; /etc/resolv.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"

        <p>
          Replace <em class="replaceable"><tt>&lt;IP address of the
          nameserver&gt;</tt></em> with the IP address of the DNS most
          appropriate for the setup. There will often be more than one entry
          (requirements demand secondary servers for fallback capability). If
          you only need or want one DNS server, remove the second
          <span class="emphasis"><em>nameserver</em></span> line from the
          file. The IP address may also be a router on the local network.

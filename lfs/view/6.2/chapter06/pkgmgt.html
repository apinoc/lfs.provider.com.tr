          6.3. Package Management
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book. A
        Package Manager allows tracking the installation of files making it
        easy to remove and upgrade packages. Before you begin to wonder,
        NO&mdash;this section will not talk about nor recommend any
        particular package manager. What it provides is a roundup of the more
        popular techniques and how they work. The perfect package manager for
        you may be among these techniques or may be a combination of two or
        more of these techniques. This section briefly mentions issues that
        may arise when upgrading packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some reasons why no package manager is mentioned in LFS or BLFS
        include:

            6.3.1. Upgrade Issues
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions when
          they are released. Generally the instructions in the LFS and BLFS
          Book can be used to upgrade to the newer versions. Here are some
          points that you should be aware of when upgrading packages,
          especially on a running system.
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If one of the toolchain packages (Glibc, GCC or Binutils)
                needs to be upgraded to a newer minor version, it is safer to
                rebuild LFS. Though you <span class=
                "emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to get by rebuilding
                all the packages in their dependency order, we do not
                recommend it. For example, if glibc-2.2.x needs to be updated
                to glibc-2.3.x, it is safer to rebuild. For micro version
                updates, a simple reinstallation usually works, but is not
                guaranteed. For example, upgrading from glibc-2.3.4 to
                glibc-2.3.5 will not usually cause any problems.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If a package containing a shared library is updated, and if
                the name of the library changes, then all the packages
                dynamically linked to the library need to be recompiled to
                link against the newer library. (Note that there is no
                correlation between the package version and the name of the
                library.) For example, consider a package foo-1.2.3 that
                installs a shared library with name <tt class=
                "filename">libfoo.so.1</tt>. Say you upgrade the package to a
                newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared library with
                name <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. In this case, all
                packages that are dynamically linked to <tt class=
                "filename">libfoo.so.1</tt> need to be recompiled to link
                against <tt class="filename">libfoo.so.2</tt>. Note that you
                should not remove the previous libraries until the dependent
                packages are recompiled.

          The following are some common package management techniques. Before
          making a decision on a package manager, do some research on the
          various techniques, particularly the drawbacks of the particular

            Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not
            find the need for a package manager because they know the
            packages intimately and know what files are installed by each
            package. Some users also do not need any package management
            because they plan on rebuilding the entire system when a package
            is changed.

          <p>
            This is a simplistic package management that does not need any
            extra package to manage the installations. Each package is
            installed in a separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1
            is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt> and a
            symlink is made from <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt> to
            <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</tt>. When installing a new
            version foo-1.2, it is installed in <tt class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg/foo-1.2</tt> and the previous symlink is
            replaced by a symlink to the new version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Environment variables such as <tt class="envar">PATH</tt>,
            <tt class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>, <tt class=
            "envar">MANPATH</tt>, <tt class="envar">INFOPATH</tt> and
            <tt class="envar">CPPFLAGS</tt> need to be expanded to include
            <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/foo</tt>. For more than a few
            packages, this scheme becomes unmanageable.

          </div>
          <p>
            This is a variation of the previous package management technique.
            Each package is installed similar to the previous scheme. But
            instead of making the symlink, each file is symlinked into the
            <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> hierarchy. This removes the need
            to expand the environment variables. Though the symlinks can be
            created by the user to automate the creation, many package
            managers have been written using this approach. A few of the
            popular ones include Stow, Epkg, Graft, and Depot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The installation needs to be faked, so that the package thinks
            that it is installed in <tt class="filename">/usr</tt> though in
            reality it is installed in the <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg</tt>
            hierarchy. Installing in this manner is not usually a trivial
            task. For example, consider that you are installing a package
            libfoo-1.1. The following instructions may not install the
            package properly:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1
make
make install</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not
            link to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package that
            links against libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
            <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt>
            instead of <tt class="filename">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</tt> as you
            would expect. The correct approach is to use the <tt class=
            "envar">DESTDIR</tt> strategy to fake installation of the
            package. This approach works as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Most packages support this approach, but there are some which do
            not. For the non-compliant packages, you may either need to
            manually install the package, or you may find that it is easier
            to install some problematic packages into <tt class=
            "filename">/opt</tt>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this technique, a file is timestamped before the installation
            of the package. After the installation, a simple use of the
            <span><strong class="command">find</strong></span> command with
            the appropriate options can generate a log of all the files
            installed after the timestamp file was created. A package manager
            written with this approach is install-log.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has two
            drawbacks. If, during installation, the files are installed with
            any timestamp other than the current time, those files will not
            be tracked by the package manager. Also, this scheme can only be
            used when one package is installed at a time. The logs are not
            reliable if two packages are being installed on two different
            consoles.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this approach, a library is preloaded before installation.
            During installation, this library tracks the packages that are
            being installed by attaching itself to various executables such
            as <span><strong class="command">cp</strong></span>,
            <span><strong class="command">install</strong></span>,
            <span><strong class="command">mv</strong></span> and tracking the
            system calls that modify the filesystem. For this approach to
            work, all the executables need to be dynamically linked without
            the suid or sgid bit. Preloading the library may cause some
            unwanted side-effects during installation. Therefore, it is
            advised that one performs some tests to ensure that the package
            manager does not break anything and logs all the appropriate
            files.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a separate
            tree as described in the Symlink style package management. After
            the installation, a package archive is created using the
            installed files. This archive is then used to install the package
            either on the local machine or can even be used to install the
            package on other machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is used by most of the package managers found in
            the commercial distributions. Examples of package managers that
            follow this approach are RPM (which, incidentally, is required by
            the <a href=
            "http://lsbbook.gforge.freestandards.org/package.html#RPM"><i>Linux
            Standard Base Specification</i></a>), pkg-utils, Debian's apt,
            and Gentoo's Portage system. A hint describing how to adopt this

            This scheme, unique to LFS, was devised by Matthias Benkmann, and

            "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/"><i>Hints
            Project</i></a>. In this scheme, each package is installed as a
            separate user into the standard locations. Files belonging to a
            package are easily identified by checking the user ID. The
            features and shortcomings of this approach are too complex to

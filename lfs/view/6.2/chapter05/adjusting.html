          5.7. Adjusting the Toolchain
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the temporary C libraries have been installed, all tools
        compiled in the rest of this chapter should be linked against these
        libraries. In order to accomplish this, the linker and the compiler's
        specs file need to be adjusted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linker, adjusted at the end of the first pass of Binutils, needs
        to be renamed so that it can be properly found and used. First,
        backup the original linker, then replace it with the adjusted linker.
        We'll also create a link to its counterpart in <tt class=
        "filename">/tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin</tt>
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">mv -v /tools/bin/{ld,ld-old}
mv -v /tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin/{ld,ld-old}
mv -v /tools/bin/{ld-new,ld}
ln -sv /tools/bin/ld /tools/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/bin/ld</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        From this point onwards, everything will link only against the
        libraries in <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next task is to point GCC to the new dynamic linker. This is done
        by dumping GCC's &ldquo;<span class="quote">specs</span>&rdquo; file
        to a location where GCC will look for it by default. A simple
        <span><strong class="command">sed</strong></span> substitution then
        alters the dynamic linker that GCC will use:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">SPECFILE=`dirname $(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)`/specs &amp;&amp;
gcc -dumpspecs &gt; $SPECFILE &amp;&amp;
sed 's@^/lib/ld-linux.so.2@/tools&amp;@g' $SPECFILE &gt; tempspecfile &amp;&amp;
mv -vf tempspecfile $SPECFILE &amp;&amp;
unset SPECFILE</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        <span>It is recommended that the above command be copy-and-pasted in
        order to ensure accuracy.</span> Alternatively, the specs file can be
        edited by hand. This is done by replacing every occurrence of
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo; with
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to visually inspect the specs file in order to verify the
        intended changes have been made.
      </p>

          <p>
            If working on a platform where the name of the dynamic linker is
            something other than <tt class="filename">ld-linux.so.2</tt>,
            replace &ldquo;<span class="quote">ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;
            with the name of the platform's dynamic linker in the above
            commands. Refer back to <a href="toolchaintechnotes.html" title=
            "5.2.&nbsp;Toolchain Technical Notes">Section 5.2,
            &ldquo;Toolchain Technical Notes,&rdquo;</a> if necessary.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        During the build process, GCC runs a script (<span><strong class=
        "command">fixincludes</strong></span>) that scans the system for
        header files that may need to be fixed (they might contain syntax
        errors, for example), and installs the fixed versions in a private
        include directory. There is a possibility that, as a result of this
        process, some header files from the host system have found their way
        into GCC's private include directory. As the rest of this chapter
        only requires the headers from GCC and Glibc, which have both been
        installed at this point, any &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">fixed</span>&rdquo; headers can safely be removed. This helps
        to avoid any host headers polluting the build environment. Run the
        following commands to remove the header files in GCC's private
        include directory <span>(you may find it easier to copy and paste
        these commands, rather than typing them by hand, due to their
        length)</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">GCC_INCLUDEDIR=`dirname $(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)`/include &amp;&amp;
find ${GCC_INCLUDEDIR}/* -maxdepth 0 -xtype d -exec rm -rvf '{}' \; &amp;&amp;
rm -vf `grep -l "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" ${GCC_INCLUDEDIR}/*` &amp;&amp;
unset GCC_INCLUDEDIR</kbd></pre>
      <div class="caution">

        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            At this point, it is imperative to stop and ensure that the basic
            functions (compiling and linking) of the new toolchain are
            working as expected. To perform a sanity check, run the following
            commands:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">echo 'main(){}' &gt; dummy.c
cc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /tools'</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            If everything is working correctly, there should be no errors,
            and the output of the last command will be of the form:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><tt class=
          "computeroutput">[Requesting program interpreter:
    /tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2]</tt></pre>
          <p>
            Note that <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt> appears as the
            prefix of the dynamic linker.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the output is not shown as above or there was no output at
            all, then something is wrong. Investigate and retrace the steps
            to find out where the problem is and correct it. This issue must
            be resolved before continuing on. First, perform the sanity check
            again, using <span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>
            instead of <span><strong class="command">cc</strong></span>. If
            this works, then the <tt class="filename">/tools/bin/cc</tt>
            symlink is missing. Revisit <a href="gcc-pass1.html" title=
            "5.4.&nbsp;GCC-4.0.3 - Pass 1">Section 5.4, &ldquo;GCC-4.0.3 -
            Pass 1,&rdquo;</a> and install the symlink. Next, ensure that the
            <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> is correct. This can be checked by
            running <span><strong class="command">echo $PATH</strong></span>
            and verifying that <tt class="filename">/tools/bin</tt> is at the
            head of the list. If the <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> is wrong it
            could mean that you are not logged in as user <tt class=
            "systemitem">lfs</tt> or that something went wrong back in
            <a href="../chapter04/settingenvironment.html" title=
            "4.4.&nbsp;Setting Up the Environment">Section 4.4,
            &ldquo;Setting Up the Environment.&rdquo;</a> Another option is
            that something may have gone wrong with the specs file amendment
            above. In this case, redo the specs file amendment, being careful
            to copy-and-paste the commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all is well, clean up the test files:
          </p>

          "command">rm -v dummy.c a.out</kbd></pre>

            Building TCL in the next section will serve as an additional
            check that the toolchain has been built properly. If TCL fails to
            build, it is an indication that something has gone wrong with the
            Binutils, GCC, or Glibc installation, but not with TCL itself.

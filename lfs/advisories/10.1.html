         Checking what you have prepared is easier if you can create symlinks

         the LFS and BLFS advisories in your browser. -->

    <p style="font-style: italic;">This page is in alphabetical order of packages,
    and if a package has multiple advisories the newer come first.</p>

    <h3>Bison</h3>

    <h4>10.1 NNN PackageName (LFS)  Date: 2021-03-01  Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>Breif details here. See

    <h3>Expat</h3>

    <h4>10.1 052 Expat  Date: 2021-05-29  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <!-- slackware rated ths as medium, no current state at NVD -->
    <p>Expat before 2.4.0 is vulnerable to Denial of Service ('billion laughs')
    attacks. The vulnerability was initially for versions up to 2.1, but
    protection hs been strengthened in the 2.4.0 release: see
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-052">10.1-052</a></p>

    <h3>Linux Kernel</h3>

    <h4>10.1 062 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-06-16  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.12.10, several security vulnerabilities were fixed in the
    Bluetooth stack, the Xen stack, and the Wireless stack. The Bluetooth
    and Xen stack vulnerabilities allow for local users to cause a kernel panic.
    The Wireless stack vulnerabilities allow for remote attackers to exfiltrate
    data from a system, inject malicious packets and network frames into the
    stream, and decrypt packets that are sent from wireless cards. Additional
    fixes were made for issues in the ath10k and ath11k wireless drivers.
    For more information, see the information in
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-062">10.1-062</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 054 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-03-31  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux 5.12.7 and all earlier kernels back to 2.6.12 a "confused
    deputy" weakness exists, which makes it possible to trick another process
    (which may have different credentials) to write to its own /proc/$pid/attr/
    files, leading to unexpected and possibly exploitable behaviors. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-054">10.1-054</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 005 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-03-15  Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>In Linux 5.11.3 or earlier there are vulnerabilities in iSCSI
	 subsystem which can lead to potential privilege escalation.  See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-005">10.1-005</a></p>

    <!-- End of Linux Kernel -->

    <h3>OpenSSL</h3>
    <h4>10.1 011 OpenSSL (LFS) Date: 2021-03-26 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL-1.1.1k, two high severity security vulnerabilities were fixed
    that can lead to a complete bypass of the CA Certificate Store checks, and
    also one that can lead to crashes for applications that use OpenSSL.
    Updating to OpenSSL-1.1.1k is suggested as soon as possible.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-011">10.1-011</a>.</p>

    <h3>Python 3</h3>

    <a id="sa-10.1-035"/>
    <h4>10.1 035 Python (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-04-29 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Python3 before 3.9.4 'pydoc' can be used to read arbitrary files,
    including those containing sensitive data. Update to Python-3.9.4 or later.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-035">10.1-035</a></p>

    rebuilfding
    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.<p>
    Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use case, and what
    action to take.

     <h1>LFS Security Advisories</h1>

     <p>At one time, vulnerabilities were mentioned on the old LFS-security
     list, but that has become defunct. In recent times, BLFS has noted
     vulnerabilities in its Errata sections, but while LFS tickets for new
     versions have sometimes mentioned security fixes, the only way to keep
     on top of that has been to read the lfs-book list.</p>

     <p>Now, for items since LFS-10.0 (and BLFS-10.0) were released on 1st
     September 2020, advisories are (sometimes belatedly for 10.0 items)
     being documented. There will be separate pages for each release of the
     book (covering up to the next release) and there is also a consolidated
     page for all LFS and BLFS security advisories.</p>

     <p>lease note that vulnerabilities to package versions before those in
     our release are not noted, so if you are running a version of LFS before
     10.0 you should check the Errata for past releases as well as monitoring
     the items here, and similarly if you are not on the current release you
     should check the advisories for the previous release(s).

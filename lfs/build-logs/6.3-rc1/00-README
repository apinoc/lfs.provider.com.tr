These are build logs for the build of LFS-6.3-rc1.

Depending on your host, the chapter 5 (and some chapter 6) tests may be slightly
different, however deviation should be fairly minimal. Obviously, if your system
passes more tests than these logs show, all the better. Most chapter 6 tests
should be the same as these with some exceptions for architecture differences
(i.e. i686 vs. i586). One difference worth noting is that AMD XP2?00+ tend to
fail a couple more gcc tests than Pentiums.

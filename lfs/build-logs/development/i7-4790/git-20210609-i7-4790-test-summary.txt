Test results from building LFS git 20210609 on a Haswell i7.

This is with a patch for gcc-11.1.0 to allow it to build
firefox-89 and later firefoxes.

This build uses the packages' own default CFLAGS.

For tests, I'm only really concerned about test failures.

glibc-2.33 3 failures

FAIL: io/tst-lchmod
FAIL: misc/tst-ttyname

it starts to look as if elf/tst-cpu-features-cpuinfo does not fail
on semi-recent intel machines.

zlib-1.2.11 all OK

bzip2-1.0.8 all 6 tests passed

xz-5.2.5 all 9 tests passed

zstd-1.5.0 No mention of any 'FAIL'.

file-5.40 seems ok

m4-1.4.18 All checks successful, then 157 PASS, 0 FAIL.

bc-4.0.1 All tests (dc, bc) passed

flex-2.6.4 All 114 tests passed

tcl-8.6.10 Passed 30147,  Failed 0
 For some reason I had not downloaded the newer tcl-8.6.11
 and I had missed the last item in two of the seds, but it
 nevertheless worked ok for the tests and for gitk.

expect5.45.4 Passed 29, Failed 0

dejagnu-1.6.2 No failures (5 and 77 expected passes)

binutils-2.36.1

7 failures in gold

mpc-1.2.1 all 69 PASS

attr-2.5.1 both tests PASS

libcap-2.50 both PASSED

gcc-11.1.0
 Variation: I added a patch from upstream to fix breakage when trying
 to use g++ to compile firefox-89.0 (that is a regression, g++-10.2.0
 is apparently able to build it, as is clang).

g++ 3 unexpected failures

UNRESOLVED: 30_threads/this_thread/95989.cc compilation failed to produce executable

Note: on my normal optimized build that latter test was perhaps
not run, there is no mention of it in the full test log.

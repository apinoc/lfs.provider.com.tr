This is a fast moving target so there may not be any logs, or the logs that are
here might not represent what is in the book. They should serve for a general
idea, though.

These tests were derived from a build of SVN-20051127. The build host was an LFS
SVN-20050831 (GCC4) system with an AMD XP2400+ processor.

Depending on your host, the chapter 5 (and some chapter 6) tests may be slightly
different, however deviation should be fairly minimal. Obviously, if your system
passes more tests than these logs show, all the better. Most chapter 6 tests
should be the same as these with some exceptions for architecture differences
(i.e. i686 vs. i586). One difference worth noting is that AMD XP2?00+ tend to
fail a couple more gcc tests than Pentiums.

These logs were graciously provided by Randy McMurchy and were created running
"make check > packagename-version 2>&1" or whatever the make target is for the
specific package.

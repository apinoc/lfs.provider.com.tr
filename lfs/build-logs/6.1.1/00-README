These tests were derived from a build of LFS-6.1.1. The build host was an
LFS-6.1 system with an AMD XP2400+ processor.

Depending on your host, the chapter 5 (and some chapter 6) tests may be slightly
different, however deviation should be fairly minimal. Obviously, if your system
passes more tests than these logs show, all the better. Most chapter 6 tests
should be the same as these with some exceptions for architecture differences
(i.e. i686 vs. i586). One difference worth noting is that AMD XP2?00+ tend to
fail a couple more gcc tests than Pentiums.

These logs were created running "make check > packagename-version 2>&1" or
whatever the make target is for the specific package.

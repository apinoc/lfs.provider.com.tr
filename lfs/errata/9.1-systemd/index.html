         <ul>
           <li>CVE-2020-1967: Crash in OpenSSL during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake.
               To patch it, upgrade to OpenSSL-1.1.1g or later using the instructions
               from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/openssl.html">OpenSSL</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2019-18348: potential for malicious HTTP header injection if the
               attacker controls the url parameter followed by an HTTP header.
               To patch it, upgrade to Python-3.8.3 or later using the instructions
               from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/Python.html">Python</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-8492: Inefficient regular expression in urllib can be exploited
               to cause a denial of service. The regex was fixed in Python-3.8.3 and
               prevents "catastrophic backtracking".
               To patch it, upgrade to Python-3.8.3 or later using the instructions
               from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/Python.html">Python</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-10543: Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular
               expression in Perl. To patch it, upgrade to Perl-5.30.3 or later using
               the instructions from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/perl.html">Perl</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-10878: Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced
               by a crafted regular expression. To patch it, upgrade to
               Perl-5.30.3 or later using the instructions from the 9.1 book with
               the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/perl.html">Perl</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-12723: Buffer overflow caused by a crafed regular
               expression. To patch it, upgrade to Perl-5.30.3 or later using the
               instructions from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/perl.html">Perl</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-12049: Denial of service problem caused by overloading
               file descriptors in D-Bus. A local attacker could cause the
               system D-Bus daemon to run out of file descriptors by repeatedly
               connecting to the server and sending FDs that would get leaked.
               To patch this vulnerability, upgrade to D-Bus-1.12.18 or later
               using the instructions from the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/dbus.html">D-Bus</a>
               from the development book.</li>
            <li>CVE-2019-20907: infinite loop when reading TAR files. To patch
               it, upgrade to Python-3.8.5 or higher using the instructions from
               the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/python.html">Python</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2016-10228: infinite loop in the iconv program when invoked
               with the -c option with invalid multi-byte input sequences.
               To fix this, upgrade to glibc-2.32 using the instructions from
               the 9.1 book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/glibc.html">Glibc</a>
               from the development book.</li>
           <li>CVE-2020-10029: stack corruption when using trigonometric
               functions with a pseudo-zero argument on x86. To fix this,
               upgrade to glibc-2.32 using the instructions from the 9.1
               book with the version of
               <a href="../../view/systemd/chapter08/glibc.html">Glibc</a>

           <li>CVE-2020-1752: use-after-free vulnerability in the glob
               function when expanding ~user. To fix this, upgrade to
               glibc-2.32 using the instructions from the 9.1 book
               with the version of

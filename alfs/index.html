     <h1>What is Automated Linux From Scratch?</h1>
     <p>Automated Linux From Scratch (ALFS) is a project that allows
	building the LFS system automatically. It also allows building packages
        from the BLFS book, but that needs some manual intervention.
     </p>

     <h2>Why would I want to use ALFS?</h2>
     <p>After having gone through the LFS and BLFS books more than 2 or 3
        times, you will quickly appreciate the ability to automate the task
        of compiling the software you want for your systems.</p>

     <p>The goal of ALFS is to <em>automate</em> the process of creating an
        LFS system.
	It seeks to follow the book as closely as possible by directly
        extracting instructions from the XML sources. This is the reason why
        it may also be used as a test of the current book instructions.
     </p>

     <h2>How is ALFS implemented?</h2>
     <p>
	The official implementation of ALFS is called <em>jhalfs</em>.
	It was originally created by Jeremy Huntwork, then developed and
	maintained by Manuel Canales Esparcia, George Boudreau, Thomas
	Pegg, and Pierre Labastie. It has become a light-weight, practical
        method of automating an LFS build. It is a Bash shell script that
        makes use of Git and xsltproc to first download the XML sources
        of the Linux From Scratch book and then extract any necessary commands,
	placing them into executable shell scripts. If you do not already
	have the necessary source packages in place on your system, jhalfs
	can fetch them. Finally, jhalfs generates a Makefile which will
	control the execution of the shell scripts, allowing for recovery
	if the build should encounter an error. A framework to use package
	management has been added by Pierre Labastie. 
     </p>

     <p>Due to a lack of developers, jhalfs is maintained as a rolling release.
        It can be obtained by cloning the git repository:</p>
     <div class="cmd">
	<p>git clone git://git.linuxfromscratch.org/jhalfs.git jhalfs</p>
     </div>
<!--
     <p>A fork of jhalfs, aiming at porting the scripts to Python, is hosted on
        github:</p>
     <div class="cmd">
	     <p>git clone https://github.com/automate-lfs/jhalfs.git</p>
     </div>
     <p>To know what book versions are supported by each jhalfs version,
        please see
        <a href="https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/wiki/SupportedBooks">
         https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/wiki/SupportedBooks</a>.</p>
-->
     <p>An extension of ALFS aimed at automating the building
	of packages in the BLFS book is now included in jhalfs. It
        still needs editing some scripts (about 1%), mainly when the book
        layout diverges from standard, but works rather well and
        most of the packages can be built automatically.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
     <p>Before jhalfs, an implementation named nALFS was developed. A more
	ambitious project, named simply alfs was designed around 2004, but
	was never pushed to completion.</p>
    <h3>nALFS</h3>
     <p>The first ALFS implementation was nALFS by Neven Has. nALFS was a
	small program written in C. It first parsed an XML profile that
	contained information concerning the LFS build process into a series
	of internal commands. It could then execute these at your discretion,
	thus automating the compilation of LFS.</p>
    <h3>alfs</h3>
     <p>There were many in-depth features that had been requested for ALFS
	implementations. Because of this, development had been slated for
	an entirely new build tool which would have been called alfs.
	Eventually, the ease of
	use of jhalfs ultimately pushed development of alfs to the bottom
	of the stack.</p>

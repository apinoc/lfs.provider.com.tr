      <h2>Obtain jhalfs</h2>
      <p>jhalfs is maintained as a rolling release. It can be obtained from
         the git repository:</p>
      <div class="cmd"><p>git clone
         git://git.linuxfromscratch.org/jhalfs.git</p></div>
      <h2>Packages required for jhalfs</h2>
      <p>Before it can parse the LFS book for commands, jhalfs needs to have a
         local copy of the book's XML source. Currently, jhalfs relies on <a
         href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> to ensure that it
         has the most up-to-date version of the LFS Book. There are <a
         href="/blfs/view/stable/general/git.html">build
         instructions</a> in BLFS.</p>
      <p>To extract the commands from the LFS book, jhalfs relies on xsltproc
         from the <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</a> package and
         its dependencies.
         There are <a href="/blfs/view/stable/general/libxslt.html">build
         instructions</a> in BLFS.</p>
      <p>If you want jhalfs to automatically download the source packages LFS
         uses, you'll need to have <a
         href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">wget</a> installed.
         There are <a href="/blfs/view/stable/basicnet/wget.html">build
         instructions</a> in BLFS.</p>

     <h1>Support for LFS Projects</h1>
     
     <p>The LFS project offers support in a number of ways. However, we ask 
        that you make use of them in the following order and according to the 
        guidelines for each method.
     </p>
     
     <h2>Errata</h2>
     
     <p>As a result of bugs and security warnings, please be sure to read 
        the errata page for any modifications needed to the LFS build.</p>
     
     <p><a href="/lfs/errata/stable/">Stable LFS Errata</a></p>
     
     <p><a href="/lfs/errata/development/">Development LFS Errata</a></p>

     <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
     
     <p>The list of Frequently Asked Questions can be found here: <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>. 
        Quite often, problems you encounter in building LFS have already been discovered and
        a solution found and documented. Checking here first saves you time and grievance as 
        often developers are not keen on repeatedly answering questions that have already been
        answered.
     </p>
     
     <h2 id="searchml">Search the Mailing Lists</h2>
     
     <p>If you haven't found your particular problem listed in the FAQ, try searching the mailing
        lists, as the problem may have only recently been found, or is rare enough to not warrant
        a FAQ entry.  You can use the search form and button on any web page within the site, or
        for more advanced searching, visit the <a href="/search.html">search page</a> 
        directly.
     </p>
     
     <h2 id="irc">IRC</h2>
     
     <p>If you have tried both of the above and still have not found a solution, 
        feel free to pop into one of our IRC channels located at 
        <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat">irc.libera.chat</a></p>

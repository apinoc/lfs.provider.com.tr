    <h1>What is the LFS LiveCD?</h1>
     
     <p>A LiveCD is a CD that is able to boot your system into a 'live',
     working operating system, independent of anything on your hard drive. It's
     a little different than an installation CD, which boots your system into a
     program that will guide you through the installation of some system onto
     your hard drive.  With a LiveCD, you have an entire system contained on
     the CD and with that, the freedom to do nearly anything that a system
     installed on your hard drive can.</p> <!-- FIXME: the fact that LFS LiveCD
     is not a "perfect" Linux system is a bug. -->
     
     <p>The LFS LiveCD is geared specifically toward providing a reliable host
     system for the purpose of building <a href="/lfs/index.html">Linux From
     Scratch</a>.  Therefore, it may not be what you would envision as a
     "perfect" Linux system. It should, however, provide you with a comfortable
     enough environment so that you can, in turn, build your own "perfect"
     system.  </p>
     
     <p>For a more detailed description of the current version of the LiveCD
     read the <a href="/livecd/documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>
     
     <h2>Why would I want to use the LFS LiveCD?</h2>
     
     <p><em>It provides a known good host for building LFS</em><br /> At times,
     Linux distros are built in such a way that make it difficult to
     successfully build LFS using that distro as a host. Their releases may
     even contain bugs that are really only exposed with heavy compiling, as is
     done when building LFS. The LiveCD has been tested thoroughly and is known
     to successfully build the current version of LFS without deviation.  </p>
     
     <p><em>Removes the LFS prerequisite of having a Linux distro installed on
     your system</em><br /> To build LFS, you need to have a host Linux system
     with development tools. In this case, the LiveCD <i>is</i> the host
     system. This allows you to build LFS onto a completely blank machine, if
     you so desire.  </p>
     
     <p><em>Doubles as a rescue CD</em><br /> Having a LiveCD close at hand can
     be a life saver if your system breaks or suddenly refuses to boot. You can
     boot the CD, fix the error on your local system, reboot, and voila!  </p>
     
     <p><em>Includes all sources and the LFS Book</em><br /> This spares you
     from having to download all the packages individually, which can be quite
     time consuming. It also removes the need for a working internet
     connection.</p>

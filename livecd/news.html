           <dt>LiveCD Version 6.3-r2160 Released</dt>
           <dd><em>Alexander E. Patrakov - 2007/11/30</em>
             <p>The LFS LiveCD Team is proud to announce the release of the 6.3-r2160
                version of the LFS LiveCD for x86 and x86_64 architectures.
		This CD version is only a minor update. There are the following
		user-visible changes:</p>
             <ul>
	     <li><p>Speechd-up has been patched in order to be able to
                    recognize one-character messages from speakup. This fixes the
                    inability of visually-impaired users to examine punctuation
                    characters (which are important, e.g., in command lines) and
                    distinguish between upper- and lowercase letters.</p></li>
	     <li><p>The Xfmedia video player has been replaced with gxine due to bugs.</p></li>
	     </ul>
	     <p>More information about this CD is available at the
	        <a href="/livecd/documentation.html">documentation</a> page.</p>
             <p>To download the new LiveCD, visit the LFS LiveCD
                <a href="/livecd/download.html">download page</a>

           <dt>LiveCD Version 6.3-r2145 Released</dt>
           <dd><em>Alexander E. Patrakov - 2007/11/30</em>
             <p>The LFS LiveCD Team is proud to announce the release of the 6.3-r2145
                version of the LFS LiveCD for x86 and x86_64 architectures.
		The CD contains the LFS book (version 6.3 for x86 CD, and its unofficial
		x86_64 equivalent for x86_64), and a lot of software that you need to
		build your own LFS system, ask for support and perform various
		recovery tasks. For each architecture, the CD is available in
		-min, -nosrc and full variants.
		The -min CD contains only a text-mode environment, -nosrc adds the
		X window system and the Xfce desktop, while the full CD also contains
		all LFS source tarballs.
		All of the above variants are suitable as hosts for building x86
		and x86_64 LFS and CLFS systems.</p>
